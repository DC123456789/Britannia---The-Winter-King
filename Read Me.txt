Version 1.11.0 (Released March 2, 2020)
Note - this version was released by DC123456789, contact him if you have enquiries.
- Updated to CK2 v3.3.2
- Updated to ACR v0.46.1 'Imentet'
- Aengland Overhaul
	- Claiming Aengland no longer requires the existence of 2 other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms or for you to get the approval (through diplomacy or war) of all of the other kings, instead now requiring you to dominate the Anglo-Saxons for an extended period of time, quantified through 'Hegemony Score'
	- Hegemony Score is gained by controlling (directly or through tributaries) at least 50% of all Anglo-Saxon provinces, scaling according to the proportion of Anglo-Saxon provinces you control as well as the overall total
	- Aengland will now only be lost if you no longer control at least half of all Anglo-Saxon provinces or you convert to a non-Anglo-Saxon culture
	- While Bretwalda, you accumulating 'Bretwalda Authority' according to the proportion of Anglo-Saxon provinces you control as well as the overall total number of controlled provinces, as well as your diplomacy/martial/stewardship attributes
	- Once you accumulate enough Bretwalda Authority, you can take a decision to Declare Supremacy, which allows you to keep Aenglaland on succession
	- Declaring Supremacy also unlocks decisions to spend Bretwalda Authority to either Seize Control or Vassalize your subject kingdoms, to annex them to your realm
	- When you are close to unifying Aengland, the other kings of Britannia will become fearful of your growing power and join together to declare war against you (i.e. Battle of Brunanburh)
	- Defeating the coalition will allow to finish the unification and proclaim yourself King of the English, transforming Aengland into a normal empire-tier title
- Added a 2-year timer and (fairly minor) prestige requirements and costs to the County Conquest and Duchy Invasion cbs
- Gave Aelle and Clovis (after the Conquest of Soissons) a special 'Conqueror' character modifier that allows them to bypass this timer
- Using the County Conquest cb as an Anglo-Saxon ruler on another Anglo-Saxon ruler has an additional higher prestige as well as gold requirements and costs, scaling based on the size of the defender and whether or not the target province is a de jure province of the defender or borders your de jure territory
- Enabled use of the Subjugation cb by Anglo-Saxon kings on other Anglo-Saxon kings if the target is small enough
- Added a variant of the (Pagan) Kingdom Unification Subjugation cb for High Tribal Anglo-Saxons
- Anglo-Saxon provinces not controlled by their proper de jure kingdom have an increased revolt risk
- Liberation Revolts can now fire to restore Anglo-Saxon kingdoms even if the kingdom title is held as a secondary title, or to restore de jure lands to a currently existing Anglo-Saxon kingdom
- Added decisions for Anglo-Saxon kings to de jure integrate certain neighbouring duchies into their kingdom
- Added a new tributary type for Anglo-Saxons to use on other Anglo-Saxons
- Enabled (culture-restricted) claimant adventurers
- Increased revolt risk of tribal provinces of a different culture group
- Added province Cultural Revolts, which are similar to Religious Revolts except that they can trigger in provinces of the wrong culture group (with some exceptions)
	- Semi-Romanized cultured (Britons, Cumbrians, Armoricans, Vasconians, etc.), Romanized Germanic, and Romance cultured provinces will not trigger Cultural Revolts under Roman cultures, and vice versa
	- Roman cultured provinces of an organized religion will not trigger Cultural Revolts under rulers of the same religion
	- Romance cultures will not trigger Cultural Revolts against their parent Germanic cultures or their descendants, and vice versa
- Province revolts event troops now scale based on a number of additional factors (e.g. tribal provinces of a different culture/culture group will have particularly strong revolts)
- Improved scaling of Anglo-Saxon invasion event troops
- Defeat in the anti-Aenglish coalition war or the formation of at least 3 Viking Jarldoms in Aengland unlocks the Duchy Invasion cb for Anglo-Saxons against duchies in Aengland with at least one Anglo-Saxon cultured province
- Added decision for the King of a United Aengland to get cbs against Wales and Cornwall
- Renamed Anglo-Saxon duchies from 'Eorldom' to 'Ealdormanry'
- Adjusted the creation requirements for Mercia, Northumbria, and Wessex to be simpler and more transparent
- The Offa's Dyke event now removes all British Fort/Civitas/Stronghold buildings and unlocks Teulu War Hall buildings for mountain/hill Briton and Cumbrian provinces, significantly increasing their levy and garrison size
- Briton, Cumbrian, and Romano-British (if not Imperial government) dukes and duchies are now titled 'Prince' and 'Principality', like Armoricans/Bretons
- Claiming the Britannic Empire using the 'Revoke Royal Privileges' decision now copies the Britannia title history over to the Britannic Empire title
- Added some sanity checks to the Frankish invasion events
- Revised event text for the creation of Francia to be more responsive to your religion and added a bloodline for the first Frankish Emperor (based on the vanilla Carolignian bloodline)
- Raise Tribal Army decision is now cheaper and slightly stronger, but now has a timer (length decreasing with increasing prestige) and cannot be used if your Tribal Respect score is too low
- Recurring endemic plagues after the main Plague of Justinian outbreak will now also occur under the Historical setting until 750
- Added a Historical Only setting for the Plague of Justinian that will only see the main outbreak in 542 (same as the old Historical setting)
- The base retinue size is now an additive modifier to all characters rather than a floor and no longer applied to baron-tier characters
- The Viking Invasion events no longer auto-build or usurp baronies in certain provinces

KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES
 Being still in development, the mod could contain a number of undetected bugs, typos, etc... please let me know about any issue, I'd really appreciate it!

ADDITIONAL NOTES
 The game is intended to have a totally different scale from vanilla. Think CKII "zoomed in". Distances are so smaller that armies can cross the whole map in a few weeks (and this is totally realistic). The campaign spans from 479 AD to 867 AD, so it's shorter than vanilla, but there are more things happening in a shorter time. Events (even vanilla ones) happen much more frequently. Battles do NOT last for days and days and days but are much quicker (as it should be). Disease and wars and many other things make this setting more violent and deadly than vanilla, so 60-years-old rulers will be a rare sight. CBs are different, and some cultures do not need a "traditional" Casus Belli at all to declare war (anglo saxons and franks) while others like picts and irish will not invade to conquer new lands very often, but they love to just raid and plunder for riches and glory, and they do it extremely well.

 All the major characters from the books, both historical and fictional, are featured (and even some minor ones): Uther, Arthur, Merlin, Mordred, Lancelot, Galahad, Morgan, Nimue, Aelle, Derfel, Sansum, Tristan, and many others. If you know the books, you'll make many familiar encounters. For all the characters that are NOT covered by the books (especially in Ireland and Europe), I tried to be as historically accurate as possible. For example, King Clovis I of the Franks is there, as well as Syagrius, son of Aegidius, ruler of the Domain of Soissons. Ireland definitely needs more work.

DISCLAIMER
----------

Although I spent hundreds of hours working on this, especially on the map, this mod contains pieces and bits and parts taken (with extreme prejudice and total carelessness) from a number of other mods out there. There is stuff taken from GOT, CK2+, Lux Invicta, Magnate Lords, Norse Mod, Better Rebels, The Prince and The Thane, and probably many others. I basically took whatever I liked from whatever source and tweaked it to make it fit this specific dark age arthurian setting.

The problem is I didn't ask permission to anyone of you. The reason is as simple as this: I never really thought the mod was going to be released, actually I was sure I was going to give up much sooner. But against all odds it has come to a playable beta version, and now releasing it makes more sense.

I can only do two things: first of all, I apologize to anyone whose work is in here. I should have asked for your permission beforehand. Second, I grant to all CK2 modders the right to do whatever you want with MY work (no need to ask). I guess someone could be interested in using the map for other mods, or some graphic stuff, or even some scripting. It's ok, you're welcome to take any part of it!
