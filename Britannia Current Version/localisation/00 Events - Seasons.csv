EVTOPTB314003;We pray to God for a mild winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME314010;The Great Cold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314010_christian;Since the Creation, every year has had a winter, but this particular one seems to be much colder and harsher than normal. Across Gallia and Britannia, trees and plants freeze to death beneath layers of snow and ice, while heavy storms have made the Mediterranean almost impossible to sail, disrupting trade and fishing. As the whole world prays for the cold to pass, it seems like this winter, and most likely the ones following it, will be much colder and last much longer than those we were used to. With grain prices at an all-time high and every lord, chieftain, and peasant hoarding bread and wheat, famine is spreading throughout the known world, and some even speak of the end of times... Even if this blasted winter does end, we can expect more short summers and harsh winters ahead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314010_manichean;Ever since the Second Creation, there have been summers and winters, caused by the conflict between the good Father of Greatness and the King of Darkness. Now, however, it seems like the King has the upper hand, as the current winter far exceeds those before it in both coldness and harshness. Reports from all over the known world tell of frozen fields and restless seas, and deserted settlements dot the countryside in increasing numbers. With this winter having been predicted to last far longer than usual, and with a high chance of this setting the new precedent for the coming years, every lord, chieftain and peasant now desperately hoards supplies increasingly rare bread and wheat as famine tolls over the horizon. Some of the more pessimistic believers are even preaching that this is the beginning of the foretold apocalypse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314010_pagan;Though there have been harsh winters before, this one seems to surpass all those that preceded it in its harshness and extreme coldness. Infants freeze to death in their cradles, and warriors in their armor. The seas are haunted by never-ceasing storms, crushing most ships which dare leave port. Famine ensues as grain disappears from markets everywhere, and it seems like the years to follow will not enjoy warm, or even temperate summers. Priests everywhere ceaselessly pray in the temples and make great sacrifices to the gods, but for now, their begging has gone unanswered. It could be that the gods mean for this unending winter to be the end of the world? Maybe, even, this cold marks the twilight of the gods themselves... Even if this blasted winter does end, we can expect more short summers and harsh winters ahead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314010_hellenic;Since Pluto abducted Proserpina to be his wife in the underworld, her mother Ceres, goddess of agriculture and grain, has created a winter in her grief every year, but this particular winter seems to be harsher and colder than all those the goddess has created before. The Mediterranean has become almost impossible to sail due to heavy storms, harming trade and fishing and dragging many unfortunate sailors into Neptune's domain. Grain prices are at an all time high, with the commodity becoming scarcer with every passing day, the priests consider all kinds of sacrifices to please the gods and end this scourge. Some oracles, though, predict that this winter will never pass at all... and even if this winter does end, we can expect more short summers and harsh winters ahead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314010_scythian;Every year has a winter and a summer, but this year, the cold has come fiercer and harsher than ever before. Mighty riders freeze upon their horses, and their steeds follow a similar fate. Word from the east has it that the steppes are frozen over completely, with no grass left for the horses to eat, leading to them to slowly starve just as their owners do now that grain is scarce and prices rice to a level never seen before. Sacrifices are made to the gods and spirits every day, with the goal of pleasing them and ending this cold scourge, but to no avail so far. Some shamans even predict that this winter will not simply pass this year, but that is the beginning of an eternal winter... Regardless, we are up for some hard times, for even if this winter does end, we can expect more short summers and harsh winters ahead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314010;The Lord preserve us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC314010;The Father preserve us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD314010;We are up for some harsh times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE314010;Iupiter preserve us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF314010;May the cold pass soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME314011;End of the Great Cold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314011_christian;It seems like those who predicted the long winters to be the start of the apocalypse were wrong after all. Though the winters are still longer than before, the worst seems to be over, and we can look to the future with hope. Cheerful psalms are being sung in churches all throughout the known world - maybe the sins of mankind were not grave enough to evoke the anger and punishment of the Lord just yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314011_jewish;Though the winters are still colder and longer than in the times before this great cold, the worst seems to be over. While some radical zealots regret that the foretold apocalypse has not come to free the Jewish people everywhere, most people, be it Jew or Gentile, rejoice that their lives have been saved, and that their hardships now mostly seem to be over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314011_manichean;Though the winters are still colder and longer than in the times before this great cold, the worst seems to be over. It appears that the virtues of humanity finally start to outweigh its sins, as the winters decrease in length, and God is praised in all the households of the true believers. The peasants once again fruitfully work the fields, and it seems like Satan, the King of Darkness, has been kept at bay for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314011_pagan;Though the winters are still longer than before, it seems like the worst of the storm has passed. Those who predicted the end of the world and the death of the gods were wrong, as we and the gods have received a second chance after all. Though farming is still hard, we can once again look to the future with enthusiasm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314011_hellenic;It seems like Proserpina has finally been spending more time with her mother again, and Ceres' grief has been tamed. Though the winters are still longer than those we had before these years of ice and cold, it seems like the summer are becoming longer again, and we have reason to rejoice. As farmers cheerfully return to their fields, we look to the future with hope...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314011_scythian;The summers show their warmth again, and the rider once again rides his steed. It seems like the cold of the last years has passed, and though the winters are still longer than those we had before the great cold, the worst of the storm seems to be over. The priests celebrate in the temples, with large sacrifices to the merciful gods, as the farmers cheerfully return to their fields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME314012;A Warmer Period;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314012_christian;For some years now, the summers have been increasing in length, and it seems like the seasons are about the same now as they were before the great cold. Those who predicted the apocalypse have now truly been proven wrong, and the people now cheerfully thank the Lord as larger harvests are once again being brought in from the fields. Better times seem to be on the horizon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314012_jewish;For some years now, the summers have been increasing in length, and it seems like the seasons are about the same now as they were before the great cold. Clearly Elohim has not meant for this cold to lead to the apocalypse and to the deliverance of our promised people, but with larger yields being brought in by the farmers every year, only a few believers are saddened by this fact. Better times seem to be on the horizon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314012_manichean;As the seasons slowly return to their normal lengths, it becomes clear that the forces of the light are triumphing over Satan's. People cheerfully gather in the temples to celebrate this victory and the collective virtue which has led to it. Better times seem to be on the horizon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314012_muslim;The summers seem to have increased in length over the last years, and the peasants bring in larger yields every year. Clearly, this is a sign of Allah's mercy and love for His followers. More and more believers everywhere in the Ummah join their pious brethren in thanking Him in their prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314012_pagan;The winters seem to last shorter by the year, and the priests make bountiful sacrifices to the gods. Now, we finally have longer summers and a longer agricultural season again, which greatly benefits our people. The colder period seems to finally be behind us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314012_hellenic;The goddess Ceres blesses us with longer summers and shorter winters. Our farmers cheerfully bring in the crops after a long agricultural season, and we can expect longer summers in the future as well. The priests gladly make sacrifices in the temples of the gods to celebrate their recent love for their mortal subjects...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314012_scythian;Every year, the grazing season seems to last longer and longer, and it is safe to say that the cold period is finally over. Instead of ice and snow, we are now greeted by the warmth of the sun and larger yields by the farmers. The horses cheerfully gallop over soft grass again, and our priests make sacrifices to the gods to thank them for their mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314012;Hallelujah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB314012;Halleluyah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC314012;Praise be to God and his victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME314013;Fertile Times;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314013_christian;As the farmers bring in larger and larger yields every year, it becomes clear that the summers themselves are increasing in length and fertility. Truly, the earth bears fruits in amounts never seen before, and many wise believers see this as the Lord's reward to His loyal followers. Surely, we live in blessed times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314013_jewish;Over the last few years, it has become clear that the summers are increasing in length and fertility. The peasants bring in larger amounts of crops with every passing summer, and the priests in the synagogues preach of Adonai's love for his people. Truly, we live in good times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314013_manichean;It seems that the Father of Greatness is gaining ground on His adversary, as the winters decrease in length and and harshness, and the summers become longer and more fertile. The Hearers bring in larger amounts of crops every year, and the Elect devote much of their time to thanking God for his love and prowess. Truly, we live in good times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314013_muslim;Allah's love for His followers continues to grow, as the summers become longer every year, and the harvests more plentiful. From the oases of Arabia to the shores of the Mediterranean, the longer summers are celebrated by both kafir and muslim alike. Truly, we live in good times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314013_pagan;Over the last few years, it has become clear that the summers are increasing in length and fertility. As the farmers bring in increasingly large yields from the fields, the priests bring greater sacrifices to the gods as well, to thank them for their recent love and affection. More and more strong children reach adulthood, increasing the strength of our people as a whole. Truly, we live in good times...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314013_hellenic;The summers seem to last longer every year, and the priests and oracles cheerfully praise the gods for providing the peasants with larger and larger yields to bring in.

EVTDESC314013_scythian;For a few years now, every summer has been longer than the one which preceded it. The shepherds' herds continue to grow in size every year, and more and more strong children reach adulthood, increasing the strength of our people as a whole. Our horses, being well fed, grow larger and stronger as well, making our warrirors even more fearsome on the battlefield. Truly, we live in good times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME314020;Famine Strikes [Root.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314020;The frigid temperatures and early frosts have wiped out the harvests in [Root.GetName] and the surrounding provinces in the last couple of years, and now a famine has set in. Many commoners have starved to death in their homes, while others flee to neighbouring lands, severely depopulating [Root.GetName]. Many buildings now lie deserted without the manpower to maintain them, and have fallen to ruin. It will take a long time for [Root.GetName] to recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314020;What a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME314021;[abandoned_holding.GetName] Abandoned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314021;High grain prices and repeated famines have pummeled the town of [abandoned_holding.GetName] in [Root.GetName] in recent years, causing much of the population to flee to the countryside, seeking a better living there. As a result, [abandoned_holding.GetName] now lies deserted, with only a small hamlet remaining in the ruins of the former town. Enormously reduced in importance and dependent on the remaining larger settlements, it has for all intents and purposes disappeared as a major holding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314021;Terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
