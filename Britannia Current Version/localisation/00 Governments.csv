#feudal_government_desc;Urban government employs concepts spread by the Roman Empire, and revolves around a system of elected, appointed, and hereditary rulers in service to a higher power. Urban rulers can only directly own so many Holdings before they must start to delegate power - with delegated power carrying its own risks. There are several Succession Laws to pick between, each with its own merits. The Centralization Law controls the maximum size of your Demesne and the number of direct vassals you can have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
feudal_government_desc;Feudal government is much more decentralized than the centralized government of the Roman Empire and its successor states before it. It revolves around the oath between liege and his vassals, who can be autonomous to the point of virtually ruling their own petty kingdom and whose loyalty to the crown may vary...

imperial_government_desc;Imperial Government is a bureaucratic and rigidly organised system of governance employed by the Roman Empire its remnant territories. Imperial rulers rely on a expensive bureaucracy to administer the realm and draw less of their military forces from levies, instead relying on the highly organized and disciplined - though costly - legions. Under the Imperial system, the civil and military administration are completely seperate, with governors serving as administrators without any official military commands and the legions under a seperate army structure ultimately answerable only to the Imperator. The loyalty of the army and bureaucracy depends in part on the consistency of pay, and an emperor that runs into a financial crisis may find their authority quickly erode away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tribal_government_desc;Tribes are settled but agrarian. Each county can only have one Tribal 'Holding', representing the entire local tribal population - the more empty Holding slots, the more powerful the Tribal Holding. Tribal rulers are heavily dependent on their personal prestige and martial skill to exert their authority over their territories and vassals, and have difficulty ruling over large areas. Rulers are limited to the 'Elective Gavelkind' Succession Law, which tends to fragment the realm between sons on the death of the chief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

high_tribal_government_desc;High Tribal Governance is a step above the chaotic Tribalism of more remote lands, and allows for the maintenance of temples and more advanced settlements. Its disorganisation is still evident, however, and ruling authority is still dependent to a great degree on the personal skills and prestige of the ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sub_roman_brythonic_government_desc;Sub-Roman Brythonic Government is the particular form of government practiced by the Romano-British kingdoms of Sub-Roman Britain and Armorica as part of their weakening understanding of Roman culture and practices, characterized by a greater weakening of urbanization and large-scale organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
germanic_government;Germanic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
germanic_government_desc;Germanic Government is similar to the Romanized, despotic administration of the Sub-Roman governments, but with a greater infusion of Germanic laws and customs. In particular, kingdoms and realms are seen not as a unitary state but the patrimony of the king or ruler, to be divided among his heirs like any other property.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
legion_government;Legion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
legion_government_desc;The Roman legions were emblematic of the organization and discipline of the Roman Empire in its heyday, and as elite heavy infantry of the Roman army form the backbone of the Imperial army. Under Imperial governments, the legions represent the military as fully distinct from the civil administration. Only legionary commanders are allowed to be marshal and command armies apart from the Imperator and the Caesar, and each commander is tied to his respective legion under his liege while barred from holding other titles while in command. Legions that have lost their legionary base and are annihilated in battle will be destroyed, but a Roman Emperor that manages to reconquer a legion's base and area can restore them by decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
