EVTNAMEVORTIGERN1;Married to a Macsen daughter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN1;My wife is a direct female descendant of the great Imperator, Magnus Maximus, once ruler of all of Britain and Gaul. Through her, I can legitimise my own claim to this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN1;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN2;Vortigern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN2;Vortigern, King of the Pagenses, and eventual High King of all Britons - you have emerged from the Roman withdrawl of Britannia with a sizeable demesne in the west country, and your marriage to the daughter of a former emperor can only legitimise you claim to the High Kingship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN2;I was born to rule...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN3;The High Kingship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN3;Through my noble wife, and the greatness I have made for my name, I can legitimately, with the support of my followers, proclaim myself as High King of Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN3;This is a great day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVORTIGERN3;I'd rather just tend to my flock...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN4;Rebellion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN4;Your father's days as ruler of Britannia are numbered. Hated by his subjects, he is merely a puppet of the Saxons he invited to these isles. We have the support of many men, and could attempt to depose him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN4;I shall rule in his place;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVORTIGERN4;My father's rule is legitimate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN5;A Chance to Return?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN5;Your wife is convinced that she could, if you so wanted, poison the High King, and use her father's Saxon supporters to ensure that you would regain your throne as High King of all Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN5;Yes, glory shall be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVORTIGERN5;No, my time is up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN6;[From.GetFirstName]'s Return;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN6;Having cruelly disposed of his rival through murderous scheming, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has seized once more his throne and crown, taking up rule over Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN6;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN7;The Kingdom of Powys;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN7;We are no longer just peasant folk, pagenses, but rulers of a great kingdom at the heart of Britannia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN7;We are men of Powys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN9;A Message From Gaul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN9;A messenger arrived at your palace this morning, claiming to bring a message from [From.GetTitledName]. He urges you to take action against the tyrant Vortigern, whom he calls a devil worshipper. He has promised to bring with him soldiers from Gaul to aid your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN9;We shall take the fight to Powys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVORTIGERN9;No, not today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN10;Vortigern Beseiged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN10;The tyrant Vortigern has been trapped in his castle by your soldiers. The Roman priest accompanying you has begun to pray to the Lord to smite the High King's castle, and to kill him. It would appear that his days are numbered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN10;Vortigern falls here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN12;The Wrath of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN12;Some say it was merely lightening, at an opportune moment, though the priests accompanying your army insist it was divine intervention, a clear sign that God supports your cause. Either way, the thunderous boom, and the flash of light from the sky has left Vortigern's castle in a blaze. The fleeing survivors are cut down by your army, though Vortigern himself is nowhere to be seen. After several hours, the clouds pass on, and the former High King's soldiers lay down their arms, despirited. The bishops and soldiers are chanting your name, and proclaim you Imperator, and ruler of Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN12;It is over...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN13;The Fall of Vortigern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN13;The tyrant High King, Vortigern of Powys, has been killed in combat while under seige by [From.GetTitledName]. His former followers have denounced his rule, and sworn to follow [From.GetFirstName] instead. There is already talk of him being crowned as High King in his place - another step in the further Christianisation of the British Isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN13;Perhaps it is not too late...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN15;The New King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN15;Vortigern is deposed - his heir will surely lead us into a new age of British rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN15;Glory to Britannia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN16;Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN16;Finally, your fierce rival, Aurelianus, has defeated you fair in battle, signalling a victory for the Roman Christian forces of Britannia. Your future does not look good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN16;I can only beg for mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEVORTIGERN17;Vortigern Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCVORTIGERN17;The great tyrant now lies entirely at your mercy, finally defeated by the power of God and your determination and will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAVORTIGERN17;Death is the least he deserves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBVORTIGERN17;Leave him to rot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
