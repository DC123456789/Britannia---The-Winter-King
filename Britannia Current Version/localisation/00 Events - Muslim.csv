EVTNAME301800;A Storm in the Desert;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301800;Traders from the Eastern Roman Empire bring news from the Orient. The warlike tribes of the arid wastelands of Arabia Deserta have been united by a Jewish prophet, who has managed to consolidate all of the Arabian peninsula under his rule. Though the newly unified tribes have not yet moved against the Eastern Romans or the Sassanid Persians, some kind of conflict is to be expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301800;So? That's half a world away! Fetch me more wine instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301800;Jewish Arabia? That sounds promising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301801;Syria Has Fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301801;Though the prophet of the Saracens has passed away, his successors have swarmed the Eastern Roman provinces of Syria and Palestine, and fully conquered the Levant. The Jewish hordes have even conquered the holy city of Jerusalem, and according to the many rumours, the tribesmen horribly desecrated the Christian parts of the city! Other important cities like Damascus and Caesarea have also been captured by the desert warriors. What is to be expected next of these peoples?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301801;The Eastern emperor will drive these hordes back into the desert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301801;Jerusalem is ours! Am Yisra'el Chai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301802;Egypt Has Fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301802;The armies of the Arabs have invaded and conquered the Eastern Roman province of Egypt. The walls of the great city of Alexandria could not hold back the invaders, and now that the Saracens control the Nile and the ports of Egypt, the important grain trade with the rest of the Mediterranean has almost been fully halted. Roman trade with India has been ground to a halt as well. How are we to deal with this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301802;Damn it! Can these hordes not be stopped?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301802;The Egyptians shall be OUR slaves, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301803;Persia Has Fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301803;Oriental traders tell of the full destruction of the Sassanid dynasty of Persia at the hands of the Arab invaders. The Persian Empire was too worn out by wars with the Eastern Romans to protect its southern borders against the desert hordes. What started with the conquest of Mesopotamia has ended in all of Persia being subjugated to the Saracens. It helped that many of the local nobles collaborated with their new conquerers. As a result, the Saracens now rule all the lands from Libya to Bactria...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301803;I weep for the Romans, but for Persia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301803;The lands of Cyrus the Great are ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301804;News from the Orient;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301804;It seems like the Saracens have been fighting amongst themselves. A new dynasty, whose members call themselves the Umayyads, has seized power over the Arabian Empire and have made the Syrian city of Damascus its capital. They are much more outwardly focused than the earlier rulers, and their base of power is stable, but more tribal conflicts might be on the horizon for the new rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301804;At least they are also killing each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301804;They better not ruin the cause by fighting amongst themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301805;News from the Orient;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301805;Trade with the east and the outward focus of the Umayyad dynasty have brought an interesting fact to light: the Arabs are not Jewish. Their faith appears to be a new one, founded by their now-dead prophet, who was supposedly visited by angels, and wrote a holy book which was dictated by God himself. The religion is a unique mix of Abrahamic ideals and earlier Arabian paganistic traditions. In return for a hefty tax, the Muslims, as they call themselves, leave their new Christian and Jewish subjects at peace, and trade seems to be flourishing in the young empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301805;Oh... Well, they are still heathens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301805;Oh... This... changes the situation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301806;The Siege of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301806;After a siege which lasted four years, the armies of the Umayyads have retreated from Asia Minor, with Constantinople still standing tall. Even though the siege was well prepared, and the Arabs had brought a large navy to blockade the metropolis, they could not best the Eastern Romans. The Constantinopolitans instead responded with the use of a new invention of theirs: Greek Fire. This mysterious substance, the creation of which is heavily guarded and kept secret by the Eastern Romans, is a sticky liquid which supposedly continues to burn even when it floats on water. With their fleet turned to ashes on the bottom of the sea, the Saracen army had no choice but to retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301806;Let us hope that we will never have to face that Greek Fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301807;Africa Has Fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301807;The armies of the Umayyad dynasty have seized the former province of Africa, together with the great city of Carthage. Although heavy resistance was met from several Berber tribes, many other tribes have been subjugated and converted to the religion of the Arabs, which they call Islam. The Saracens are now at Europe's doorstep, with only the Visigoths in Hispania standing between us and the desert hordes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301807;The Visigoths might bring these barbarians to a standstill...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301808;Hispania Has Fallen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301808;Hispania has been swarmed by Muslim armies. Betrayed from within by envious vassals and vengeful Jews, the Visigoths were swiftly defeated by the Umayyad armies, whose ranks included mainly converted Berber warriors. Only some small Christian domains still resist Islamic rule from the mountainous north of Hispania. The Saracens are now at the Pyrenees, and their hordes are preparing to cross the mountain passes into Gaul. Will they finally deal the death stroke to western Christendom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301808;Gaul is doomed! We are all doomed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301809;The Second Siege of Constantinople;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301809;Once again, the armies of the Umayyads have sieged the city of Constantinople, and once again, they were forced to retreat. For a year, the Islamic armies and navy have sieged the City of the World's Desire, but when the Romans once again used their Greek Fire to destroy the fleet, the city could be supplied again, while the besieging army suffered famine and disease. The ambush and defeat of a second Saracen army on the way to Constantinople, combined with attacks from the Roman-allied Bulgars, was reason for the Muslims to retreat from Asia Minor. It seems like the Theodosian Walls are too strong for any invader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301809;Constantinople truly is unconquerable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
