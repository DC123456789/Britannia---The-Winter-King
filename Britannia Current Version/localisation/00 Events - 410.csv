EVTNAMEHISTORY6;The Saxons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY6;For decades now, Britannia has felt increasing pressure from Pictish and Irish raids, more so since the withdrawal of the Roman legions. Though Macsen Wledic's arrangements of the island's defences helped the situation, we need now to find a more permanent solution. Perhaps we could consider settling Germanic foederati troops near Pictavia, as the Romans once did?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY6;We'll settle some Saxons in the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHISTORY6;This is definitely a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHISTORY6;Saxons? In Britannia? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPHISTORY6A;Saxons will be settled in Caistor and Petuaria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY7;Saxons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY7;The High King of Britannia has decreed an increase in settlement of Saxon foederatus troops in our lands in order to protect the island from increasing Pictish and Irish raids. Shall we comply?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY7;We already have enough Saxons here, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHISTORY7;The additional foederati will help strengthen our borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY8;Saxon Settlements;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY8;We have decided to increase the amount of Saxons foederati in our realm to a sizeable amount. This will help us defend ourselves from Pictish incursions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY8;There is no way this is a bad idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY8TT;Saxons will be granted the provinces of Casitor and Petuaria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY12;Hen Ogledd Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY12;The Governor of Northern Britain has refused our request to settle foederati troops in his lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY12;This is an outrage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY13;Hen Ogledd Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY13;The Governor of Northern Britain has accepted our request to settle foederati troops in his lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY13;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY15;Saxon Settlements;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY15;The High King of Britannia has decreed the settlement of foederati troops in our land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY15;This will help us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHISTORY15;No way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY16;Ceint Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY16;The Governor of Ceint has refused our request to settle foederati troops in his lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY16;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY17;Ceint Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY17;The Governor of Ceint has accepted our request to settle foederati troops in his lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY17;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY18;Saxon Settlements;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY18;We have decided to increase the amount of Saxons foederati in our realm to a sizeable amount. This will help us defend ourselves from incursions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY18;There is no way this is a bad idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY18TT;Saxons will be granted the chiefdom of Portus Dubris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY21;An Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY21;If we ply the High King with wine, we may be able to persuade him to provide us with more land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY21;Yes, let us try this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHISTORY21;No, it would be dishonest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY22;An Invitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY22;We have been invited to meet with our foederate troops in the south. They are loyal men, and we have no reason to suspect them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY22;Yes, let us go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHISTORY22;No, they are clearly up to something..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY23;The High King Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY23;The Governor of Britannia has arrived, dressed in full Roman imperial regalia. Let us ply him with wine and food, and see if we can persuade him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY23;Yes, now is the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHISTORY23;Can't we just enjoy each other's company?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY24;The High King Refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY24;The Governor of Britannia has refused our invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY24;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY25;Too Much to Drink;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY25;As the evening went on, the Sais plied me with more and more wine, until eventually I fell into a drunken stupor. Hengist had a beautiful daughter, Rowena - perhaps I could persuade him to let me wed her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY25;My head hurts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY26;A Wonderful Evening;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY26;As the evening draws to a close, we said our goodbyes, and parted company. The Saxons were lovely and polite, and everyone had an enjoyable time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY26;Maybe they are just like us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY27;What Happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY27;The events of last night are all a blur. The beautiful Saxon daughter Rowena is lying next to you, mumbling something about 'a wedding'. You vaguely recall the Governor of Ceint being furious about something, but you can't quite remember what...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY27;Um, whoops...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY28;Betrayed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY28;While at a meeting with our Saxon foederati, our High King has sold us out, giving control of our kingdom to the pagans, in return for marrying his beautiful Saxon daughter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY28;How could he?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY29;A Terrible Mistake;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY29;As the events of last night return to your memory, you remember why the Governor of Ceint was so angry. The Sais had tricked you by forcing you to agree to trade the land of the Cantii to their ruler, Hengist, in return for his daughter's hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY29;Slimey buggers, these Sais...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY30;An Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY30;If we ply the Dux Brittanniarum with wine, we may be able to persuade him to provide us with more land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY30;Yes, let us try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHISTORY30;No, it would be dishonest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY33;The Death of Meirchion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY33;[From.GetTitledName] has died without an heir, leaving the future of his kingdom in doubt. The High King has indicated that he may absorb the former King's lands into his realm, and govern them himself, as is his right as High King of Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY33;Yes, this will make a nice addition to my realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHISTORY33;No, it would be too greedy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCHISTORY33;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY34;The Kingdom of Gwent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY34;Now that your eldest son is of age, it may be prudent to allow him to govern the former region of Ewyas as the King of Gwent in his own right, if he is to be prepared to follow in your footsteps as High King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY34;A fine idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBHISTORY34;No, he can learn the hard way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEHISTORY35;The Cantian Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHISTORY35;Having drunk only watered down wine and ale, you remember clearly the events of last night - incuding the governor himself throwing you the crown of Cantuaria, saying 'It's yours...'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAHISTORY35;Alcohol is a terrible, terrible thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
