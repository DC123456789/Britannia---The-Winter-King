EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS2;Aurelius Ambrosius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS2;You are Aurelius Ambrosius, last of the Romans in Britain, and governor of what remains of the province of Maxima Caesariensis. While the Britons in the north and west may have collectively thrown of the yoke of Roman rule, several Romanised Britons in the south of the island still recognise you, and Rome, as their rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS2;It is up to me to save these Britons from themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS3;The Marriage of Aurelius Ambrosius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS3;Aurelius Ambrosius has married to a native British woman. Perhaps this will be the start of a great dynasty that will save these isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS3;Perhaps this is not the end of Britannia?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS4;My Wife is Pregnant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS4;The wife of Roman governor Aurelius Ambrosius is pregnant. Perhaps her child will grow up to be a great leader in these distant lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS4;Excellent news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS5;The Birth of Ambrosius Aurelianus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS5;My wife has given birth to a baby boy, who shall be named Aurelianus, in the Roman manner. Perhaps he will become a great leader some day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS5;Wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS6;The Death of Aurelius Ambrosius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS6;Aurelius Ambrosius, Governor of Maxima Caesariensis, last of the Romans in Britannia, has died. With the continuing collapse of centralised Roman rule in southern Britain, the local British chieftains have confrimed their autonomy from Roman rule. With Gaul only tenuously under the Roman yoke, perhaps the light of their civilisation may never again touch these clouded isles. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS6;This land is my birthright! I shall retain it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAMBROSIUS6;A great governor has died. Perhaps the Britons are doomed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAMBROSIUS6;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDAMBROSIUS6;Perhaps my destiny is not in Londinium, but further west...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS7;The Collapse of Roman Authority in Britannia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS7;With the last of the Roman legions having been withdrawn from Gaul, perhaps never to return, now more than ever do we have the chance to secede from the centralised Roman rule, and return to our regional system of tribes and Kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS7;What have the Romans ever done for us?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAMBROSIUS7;Well, now you mention it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS8;A Vassal Secedes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS8;With the departure of the Roman legions from Britannia, it has become increasingly harder for us to enforce centralised Roman rule in Britannia. Taking advantage of this, one of our British vassals no longer recognises our authority over their lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS8;Ungrateful wretches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS9;A Step Too Far?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS9;With the secession of Ceint to the Sais by the High King, we are left at a peril. We could call together a council of Romans and Britons opposed to the policy of settling Saxons in our land, in an attempt to force the High King to stop his destructive policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS9;It won't  be easy, but it has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAMBROSIUS9;Sounds like a lot of unecessary hassle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS10;No Alternative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS10;Dismayed at the poor policies employed by the High King, a council of Romans and Britons, led by [Root.GetTitledName], has openly declared war on the High King, citing his failure to control the Saxons settled as foederati troops as justification for his deposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS10;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAMBROSIUS10;Actually no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS11;Civil War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS11;Civil war has broken out in the southern part of Britannia, with the pro-Roman faction, led by the great [From.GetTitledName], fighting against the High King of Britannia, in an attempt to depose him due to his fall in popularity after his decision to hand the Kingdom of Ceint over to the Sais.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS11;We shall help topple this tyrant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAMBROSIUS11;The High King may not be popular, but his rule is legitimate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAMBROSIUS11;This is not our fight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS12;The Battle of Guoloph;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS12;The Battle of Guoloph has been fought, and won by the pro-Roman forces of [Root.GetTitledName]. The armies of the High King have been scattered to the hills after many hours of tiring fighting, and it will only be a matter of time before he is kicked from his throne. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has been hailed as the hero of the day, and saluted by his troops as Imperator. The High King has agreed that [Root.GetFirstName] shall become the architect for the defence of Dinas Emrys and all the western lands, ceding Glouvia, Ceri, and Baddon in his defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS12;We are victorius!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS13;Vortigern is defeated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS13;The Battle of Guoloph was a stunning victory for [From.GetTitledName], and now peace has been achieved in the south of Britannia. [From.GetFirstName] has been granted control over the lands of Glevum and Baddon, promising that no Saxons will be settled in the areas under his control. However, the long period of fighting has left the British leadership short on supplies, and the Saxons in Cantia, while still loyal, will be baying for their payment soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS13;At last the war is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS14;An Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS14;Though your throne has been usurped, you have escaped alive, and are now in hiding. However, there are those that would support your claim should you decide to return. Your wife, [Spouse.GetFirstName], has offered to murder the current High King, in order to instigate a rebellion to place you back on your deserved throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS14;A cunning plan indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAMBROSIUS14;It's too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS15;The Saxon Plague;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS15;The dreaded Saxon Plague, bought over by the invading Germans, has infected the great [Root.GetTitledFirstName]. If he dies, it will be a great loss for Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS15;We can only pray...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS16;[Root.GetFirstName] dies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS16;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has been killed by the plague introduced to the isles by the invading Saxons. This truly is a great loss for the British effort. Perhaps now no one will stand in the way of the pagan advance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS16;A tragedy indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS17;Fall of Maxima Cæsariensis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS17;With the revolt of the Saxons and the death of the governor Aurelius Ambrosius, the former Roman province of Maxima Cæsariensis has been increasingly thrown into chaos, with the plague, wars, and civil strife devastating its cities and lands. As the former administration collapses into chaos, Aurelius's heir, [Root.GetFullName], has fled west to the safety of his family's possessions in Guenet, leaving [Root.GetHerHis] British vassals to assert their own authority in the fallen province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS17_1;With the revolt of the Saxons and the death of the governor Aurelius Ambrosius, the former Roman province of Maxima Cæsariensis has been increasingly thrown into chaos, with the plague, wars, and civil strife devastating its cities and lands. The administration of [Root.GetFullName] has slowly been sliding into chaos and [Root.GetSheHe] has largely lost control of the region, leaving [Root.GetHerHis] British vassals to assert their own authority in the fallen province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS17;I will return...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAMBROSIUS17;This is unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCAMBROSIUS17;This is troubling news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDAMBROSIUS17;Hah! Let the Wealas fight among themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEAMBROSIUS17;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEAMBROSIUS18;The Romans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAMBROSIUS18;The descendents of Aeneas and Romulus once ruled this island, but I do not remember what it is to be Roman... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAAMBROSIUS18;The world has become a lot smaller.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBAMBROSIUS18;No! The legacy of Rome will not fade on my watch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
