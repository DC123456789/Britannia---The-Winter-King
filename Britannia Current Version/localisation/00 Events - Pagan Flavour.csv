EVTNAME317000;The Weight of Living;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317000;The embarassments of age come thick and fast as your years catch up with you. Too often you find yourself slipping from your horse on an afternoon gallop, and donning your armour and gear to address your men earns you mockery and scorn in light of your failing strength. As you meekly lift yourself from bed one particularly inhospitable morning, you come to an upsetting realisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317000;...I will never ride again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME317010;Preparations for the Divination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317010;Your diviner rides swiftly into the nearby forest, shouting incoherently about the will of Agin. It is nearly midnight when he returns, smeared in mud and clutching twigs and branches of willow and linden. It is readily apparent that the time to divine the future is at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317010;We will see what path the gods have laid for us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME317011;The Ceremony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317011;It is time for the divination to begin. You and your court watch as your Seer approaches the bed of sand with a bundle of straight willow twigs. As [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] recites the incantations, your Seer drops the twigs onto the sand and crouches down to divine the future in the pattern of the fallen twigs. As [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] furrows [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHis] eyebrows, everyone leans in closer, anxiously awaiting [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHis] verdict...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317011_1;It is time for the divination to begin. You and your court watch as your Enarei approaches the bed of sand with a bundle of strips cut from the bark of the linden tree. As [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] recites the incantations, your Enarei drops the strips onto the sand and crouches down to divine the future in the pattern of the fallen bark. As [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] furrows [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHis] eyebrows, everyone leans in closer, anxiously awaiting [Root.job_spiritual.GetHerHis] verdict...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB317011;Let us hope the Gods are satisfied with this offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB317011TT;Your vassals look on with bated breath as your diviner begins to interpret the omens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME317012;A Fruitful Divination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317012;Your diviner throws himself upon the earth, staring closely at the scattered wood for what seems like an eternity. Occasionally he looks up at the sky or at an onlooker, who invariably recoil in fear at his piercing gaze. Eventually he sits up and lets his broad smile become visible, before turning to face you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317012;We have been blessed by the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME317013;An Eventless Divination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317013;Your diviner throws himself upon the earth, staring closely at the scattered wood for what seems like an eternity. Occasionally he looks up at the sky or at an onlooker, who invariably recoil in fear at his piercing gaze. After a while you notice he has become silent, and he glances over to you with a look of confusion and resignation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317013;The Gods are silent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME317014;A Troubling Divination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317014;Your diviner throws himself upon the earth, staring closely at the scattered wood for what seems like an eternity. Occasionally he looks up at the sky or at an onlooker, who invariably recoil in fear at his piercing gaze. As his movements become ever more feverish and panicked, you notice that he has begun to weep. The look of distress on his face tells you all you need to know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317014;We have been cursed by the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME317015;The Ceremony's End;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317015;Your vassals erupt in a cheer of triumph as your diviner details the blessings bestowed by the Gods, nearly drowning out the mentions of bountiful harvests and military successes he carefully recounts to the assembled crowd. As you make your way from the divining field, you happily consider the better days ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317015_1;Your vassals whisper and shuffle awkwardly in place as your diviner laments the failure of his divination. The crowd begins to thin as you turn the wood over in your hands, and the shame of your diviner as he kneels in the grass before you is evident. It has been an awkward afternoon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317015_2;A woman in your entourage lets out a loud wail as your diviner mumbles tales of misfortune and death to you, and you feel your legs shake as he turns the wood in his hands. Starvation and defeat may well await us, he explains, and you stumble back from the divining field in fearful anticipation of harder times ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB317015;Our next divination may carry different fortunes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alan_pagan_old;Cowardly Elder;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alan_pagan_old_desc;This character is seen as a coward by his people for having survived to old age and not having died a glorious death on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alan_divination_good;A Fruitful Divination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alan_divination_good_desc;The Gods have blessed this character with victories and good harvests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alan_divination_neutral;An Eventless Divination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alan_divination_neutral_desc;The Gods are silent to this character, and offer no blessings or curses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alan_divination_bad;A Troubling Divination;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alan_divination_bad_desc;The Gods have cursed this character with defeats and poor harvests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317100;You have sent out summons to all of your vassals inviting them to the Sacea festival. Those that have been baptized will have to offer gold to be exempted from this magnificent festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317100;I can hardly wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP317101;Summoned to Sacea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317101;Your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has summoned you and [From.GetHerHis] other vassals to the Sacea festival. There you will celebrate the coming of spring in a great, lavish festival and give sacrifice to the gods before taking part in a great feast where you drink to their name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317101;I wouldn't miss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP317102;Exempted from Sacea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317102;Your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], remains trapped in [From.GetHerHis] heathen ways, and now [From.GetSheHe] has summoned all of [From.GetHerHis] vassals to their Sacea festival where [From.GetSheHe] intends to honour and give sacrifice to [From.GetHerHis] pagan gods. Since you do not practise their heathen religion, you will be expected to contribute gold in order to be exempted from this festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317102;I suppose I have no choice in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB317102;As [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] is my witness, I will not pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP317103;Your payment is received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317103;[From.GetTitledFirstName], your vassal, is stubborn in [From.GetHerHis] ways and speaks only of the mercy of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], but [From.GetSheHe] has wisely decided to offer you some gold to be exempted from attending the festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317103;As well [From.GetSheHe] should.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317104;The guests have arrived, and your servants are putting the final touches on the great brushwood altar of Agin newly built for the festival. As people mingle in excitement for the extravagant festival ahead, servants whisper excitedly about the ceremonial reversal of roles to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317104;This will be a grand festival!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sacea_begins;You watch as the Sacea festival begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317105;You watch your [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s servants put the final touches on the newly built great brushwood altar of Agin as you arrive for the Sacea festival.

CHRONICLE_HELD_SACEA;[Root.GetTitledName] held the great festival of Sacea at [Root.Location.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317106;The Sacea festival opens with a great sacrifice atop the altar of Agin. What will we sacrifice to honour the gods this year?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317106;I will sacrifice my finest steeds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB317106;An offering of cattle will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC317106;A human sacrifice for Agin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP317136;Your refusal to pay is received.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317107;The sacrificial horse, the greatest of all sacrifices, stands before your diviner atop the altar where the sacred sword of Agin stands. Calling on the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], your diviner quickly tugs on a coil of rope to drag the horse to the floor. Your vassals stare in awe as your diviner strangles the animal, displaying an inhuman strength available only to the most devoted servants of the Gods. As the cries of the animal subsides, your diviner begins to flay the beast, dipping the skin into a cauldron of boiling water and then throwing it on the ground before him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317107;Glory to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC317109;The bull stands before your diviner at the centre of the great altar where the sacred sword of Agin stands. Calling for the blessing of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] on the realm, your diviner grabs the rope tying the bull's forefeet together, dragging it to the ground. Your vassals watch as your diviner strangles the bull, putting a noose around its neck and twisting a stick inside until cattle's cries subside. Your diviner then flays off the beast's skin and boils it before casting an offering of the bull's flesh and vital organs before him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317109;Praised be [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Praising the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], your diviner ceremonially pours wine over the head of your prisoner before slitting [sacea_sacrifice.GetHerHis] throat. Your vassals watch - some in horror - as your diviner collects the blood spilling from the slit throat in a bowl and pours it over the sword of Agin, whispering incantations as he does so. Two of your other seers then take your sacrifice's body and cut off [sacea_sacrifice.GetHerHis] right arm before throwing it in the air to land where it will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC317113;You are dragged to the top of the altar and forced to kneel before your captor's diviner. As he praises the name of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], the diviner pours a bowl of wine over your head, drenching your hair and spilling onto your face. As you try to squint past the dripping wine, you get a glimpse of the gleam of a knife right before it slashes through your throat.

EVTDESC317114;The guards enter your cell with a peculiar smile on their faces and bring you out to a holding area outside. You watch as the brushwood altar is set up, and as you squint at the sacred sword of Agin gleaming in the sun you suddenly get a chilling feeling that it will be you who will be sacrificed on that altar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA317114;This can't be happening to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC317136;Despite having sworn you fealty, [From.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to offer gold in order to be exempted from Sacea!
