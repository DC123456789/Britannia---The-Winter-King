EVTDESC55000;The [Root.Culture.GetName] populace in [Root.GetName] has slowly changed its customs over the past few years, and most people have adopted the ways and language of the [Root.Holder.Culture.GetName] culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55000;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55001;The [Root.Culture.GetName] populace in [Root.GetName] resents me as a ruler and feels that I am a foreigner, yet I depend on these people to collect my taxes and man my army. This simply will not do. I think it is time to bring some settlers from back home over to help out here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190041;I have started to feel strongly attached to the culture of [Root.Capital.GetName], dressing and speaking almost like a local.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA190041;I have become [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55002;With the conquest of [Root.GetName] by Germanic tribes, the urbanized culture of the Romans is decaying. Cities are being abandoned, infrastructure is decaying, and the people of the province are moving into the countryside as the tribal system once again takes hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55002;Such is the way of our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55010;After years of foreign rule, the [Root.Culture.GetName] people settled in [Root.GetName] have slowly lost their separate identity and have assimilated into the larger [Root.GetLocalRomanCulture] culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC55020;With the fall of the Romanized cities of Lloegyr, the Roman way of life is fading away in Cymry as well. The Latin tongue is slowly disappearing from the towns of [Root.GetName] as the Romans of the region assimilate into the larger Briton culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55020;The legacy of Rome is fading away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55021;With the fall of the Romanized cities of Lloegyr, the Roman way of life is fading away in Cymry as well.

EVTOPTA55021;The legacy of Rome is fading away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55030;Our people came to Britannia as a mix a different peoples, tribes of Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians alike crossing the German Sea to settle on the island we have made ours. As our people settled, they mixed together, blurring the lines between the tribes while forming a distinct culture from our cousins on the continent. Now, the people of [Root.GetName] cannot be said to be purely [Root.Culture.GetName], but something else - Anglo-Saxon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55030;A new nation is being built.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55031;While we were once divided into Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, the people of our lands have been mixing together, blurring the lines between our tribes while forming a distinct, seperate culture from our cousins across the German Sea. It is time to adopt this new identity, as not just merely [Root.Culture.GetName], but Anglo-Saxon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55031;Our tribes will become one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55035;A new culture and identity is brewing in coastal marshes south of the German Sea, as the various Germanic settlers of the area mix and interact. The people of [Root.GetName] have now begun to refer to themselves as 'Frisians', in imitation of the old Frisii tribe of the area, as the idea of a Frisian tribe and nation begins to take hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55035;An interesting development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55036;We have been settled in [Root.Capital.GetName] for many years now, in the lands left abandoned by the ancient tribe of the Frisii, and the lines between between the many settlers from the north and east have become increasingly blurred. Now, the idea of a new Frisian people has slowly taken hold in your lands and court, and it is time to embrace this new identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55036;Frisians reborn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55040;Influence from the Franks to the south and the solidification of the Frisian identity has caused a distinct shift in the culture of [Root.GetName].

EVTOPTA55040;Interesting news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55041;You are beginning to notice a shift in the Frisian identity of your lands and court. No longer just one of many Ingvaeonic peoples along the German Sea, we are now embracing a stronger, more distinct Frisian culture and identity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA55050;Interesting news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC55055;The lowlands near the mouth of the Rhenus river have long been a crossroads where empires and cultures meet. In the county of [Root.GetName] a new identity now seems to be appearing. They no longer consider themselves Frankish, but Dutch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55055;Interesting news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA55056;We are Dutch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55057;In the south and east of the Frankish heartland, a change is occuring in the culture of the region. The people of [Root.GetName] have absorbed influences from the other neighbouring Germanic peoples, and they now call themselves "Franconians".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55057;Interesting news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA55058;A new kind of Frank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55060;The long period of Frankish rule has produced a gradual but marked change in the Latin culture of [Root.GetName].

EVTOPTA55060;Interesting news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC55061;The old Roman customs have been gradually changed or abandoned in your court under the influence of your Frankish overlords, and with the language changing you are finding it harder to understand the old Latin classics.

EVTDESC55061_1;We may be Franks, but from an early age we are immersed in Latin, the language of high culture, administration, education, and the general population in its various dialects.

EVTDESC55075;While once there was a sharp division between the native Irish of the lands, and the Norse settlers that came from the east, the people of our lands have been mixing together, blurring the lines between our respective cultures as Norse men take Irish brides and concubines. Even the children of these unions see no conflict of identity, and play at being mighty Celtic champions, or brave Viking raiders, searching for new lands. It is time to adopt this new identity, as not just merely [Root.Culture.GetName], but Norse-Gael.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA55075;Our tribes shall be one, and we shall be the stronger for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
