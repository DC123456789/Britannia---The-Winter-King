EVTNAMEKNIVES6;A Plan is Formed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCKNIVES6;Though we are winning the fight against the Britons, one of your generals has suggested that it would be far easier for us to enforce our demands on the natives if we were to stage a phony peace conference, and then take their High King hostage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAKNIVES6;Yes, an excellent idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBKNIVES6;No, peace, even fake peace, is for weaklings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEKNIVES7;An Offer of Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCKNIVES7;A lone rider from the Saxon camps has arrived at your court. He claims that, though the Sais are winning the war, they too are feeling the toll of prolonged fighting, and cannot sustain battle much longer. They have invited you to attend a peace conference, in an attempt to reconcile differences between Britons and Saxons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAKNIVES7;Finally, perhaps we can have peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBKNIVES7;Peace in our time? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEKNIVES8;Peace Offer Accepted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCKNIVES8;The foolish Britons have accepted our phony offer of peace. We have invited all the rulers of the land to attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAKNIVES8;They won't see it coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEKNIVES9;An Invitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCKNIVES9;In order to end the years of fighting between the British and Saxon factions, a peace conference has been called, and we have been invited to attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAKNIVES9;Yes, let us go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBKNIVES9;As a regional high leader of the Britons, we are obliged to attend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCKNIVES9;No, we shall never negotiate with Sais!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEKNIVES10;The Peace Conference Begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCKNIVES10;The peace conference between the Saxons and the Britons, intending to resolve the years of fighting between the two, has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAKNIVES10;Finally, we shall have peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBKNIVES10;The plan has begun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEKNIVES11;The Time Has Come;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCKNIVES11;The peace conference is well underway, and now the weary Britons, filled with food and wine, have fallen asleep in the great hall. Now we can slaughter them in their hundreds, and take their High King hostage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAKNIVES11;The Saxons will rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBKNIVES11;Actually I changed my mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
