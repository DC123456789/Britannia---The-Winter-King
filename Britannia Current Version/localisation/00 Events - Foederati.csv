EVTNAMEFOEDERATI1;Foederate Province;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI1;As our men settle this province, the local natives are displaced, and our people have become dominant in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI1;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEFOEDERATI2;Foederate Employment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI2;We are employed by our British leaders as foederati troops. They pay us good money, and provide us with fertile land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI2;This will be a mutually beneficial arrangement, I'm sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEFOEDERATI3;No Longer Foederati;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI3;We have wrested control of these lands from our British overlords, and are thus longer enjoy the benefits of foederatus status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI3;We can fight our own battles now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEFOEDERATI4;No Longer Foederati;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI4;We no longer directly serve our British employers, but instead are loyal to other Germanic foederati within the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI4;A load off of my mind, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEFOEDERATI5;Foederati Vassals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI5;We now have German foederate warriors serving us in our realm. Though they fight for us, they have been granted autonomy over their lands, and any attempts to interfere might incur their wrath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI5;This will be a mutually beneficial arrangement, I'm sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEFOEDERATI6;Saxons Upset;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI6;The Saxons in this province are angry that they are no longer under the rule of one of their own, and have demanded a local be given control of the land instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI6;I knew this would be trouble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEFOEDERATI7;Foederati Without Ruler;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI7;Our Saxon foederati troops are angry that their land is not ruled by one of their own, and have petitioned us to reinstate a local ruler. They say the have the means to take the land by force if we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI7;Damnable Sais...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFOEDERATI7;No, I will not have Saxons in my realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEFOEDERATI8;No More Foederati;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI8;We no longer have any foederati settled in our realm. We will no longer have the ability to raise their troops to help us in our wars, but without those pesky settlers our realm may well be more stable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI8;I suppose we're better off without those barbarians anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
####### FOEDERATI REVOCATION EVENTS #######
EVTDESCFOEDERATI30;Our employer, [FromFrom.GetTitledName], has apparently decided that our usefulness as foederati has come and gone and has decided to terminate our employment contract. [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is now demanding that our warriors stand down and integrate into the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI30;Who are the warriors of this realm again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAFOEDERATI30;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] is informed of your refusal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFOEDERATI30;I suppose we have no choice then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBFOEDERATI30;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] is informed of your submission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI31;The foederati under the leadership of [From.GetTitledName] has rebuffed our demands, daring us to go to war with their battle-hardened warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI31;Well then, to war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFOEDERATI31;On second thought, perhaps this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI32;Undaunted by our strength, [From.GetTitledName] has declared war on us and intends to subjugate our settlements by force!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI32;We will show the Wealas what we are made of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI33;Fearing the might our armies, [From.GetTitledName] has suddenly struck a much more conciliatory tone and is appearing to back down from [From.GetHerHis] demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI33;Cowards...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI34;Rather than face the prospect of war, the foederati under the leadership of [From.GetTitledName] have decided to accept our demands and give up their special privileges and autonomy, though not without considerable grumbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI34;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI35;We have been humbled on the battlefield, and our band of foederati has been forced to disband by the very kings who hired them in the first place. No longer will we hold this privileged place in the realm, and our power to influence matters has been significantly reduced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI35;They will see the follies of their choices...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI36;Humiliated and defeated, [From.GetTitledName] has surrendered and agreed to our demands, and the band of foederati has settled down and largely disbanded. Though many Saxons still remain, their military power and threat has been considerably reduced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI36;The Saxons serve only at our discretion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI37;[foederati_employer.GetTitledName] has agreed to a white peace, and the foederati agreement has been restored to as it was before. Clearly, however, [From.GetTitledName] has come to see us as more of a threat than an asset, and we should be prepared to fight back for our rights...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI37;Are the Wealas really worthy of our service?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI38;The Saxons have agreed to a white peace, and we have restored the foederati agreement to as it was before. However, their trust in us has been seriously flayed by our demands, and perhaps this has only stoked the fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI38;Perhaps they really are getting too powerful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI39;Victorious on the battlefield, we are now in a position to demand terms on our employer, [foederati_employer.GetTitledName]. Clearly, we must send a firm message to anyone thinking of trying to revoke our privileges again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI39;We will replace [foederati_employer.GetHerHim] with a better employer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBFOEDERATI39;[foederati_employer.GetTitledName] will be taken as our hostage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCFOEDERATI39;I think it's time to end this arrangement. On our terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI40;Following [From.GetHerHis] victory on the battlefield, [From.GetTitledName] has decided that you are too much of a liability for his band of foederati, and has decided to depose you in favour of a more pliable employer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI40;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI41;Following your defeat on the battlefield, [From.GetTitledName] has decided to take you as a hostage in order to ensure your continued compliance of the foederati agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI41;The nerve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFOEDERATI42;Your victorious foederati have decided, in light of your failed attempt to revoke their status and privileges, that their foederati agreement with you is no longer worthy of being kept. [From.GetTitledName] has now declared independence with the intention of founding a new [From.Culture.GetName] kingdom, and may well be eyeing your lands greedily...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTAFOEDERATI42;We must defeat these barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
