ZEALOUS_NOTIFICATION_MSG;All for the greater glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000;A lustful wench is throwing herself at you. And she is decently pretty, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000;Excellent! I can't resist her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000;I am not interested. Send her away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1001;Why eat modestly? Food is a joy of life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1001;I prefer to satisfy my hunger with bread and water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1003;After giving my advice to a courtier on a delicate matter, he asked me to accept a small gift of gold as thanks for my help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1003;I accept the gift, reluctantly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1003;Wasn't my advice worth more than this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1004;Work can be tedious and when one problem is solved another one pops up. I tire of having to complete the same tasks over and over again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1004;Enough! Let someone else do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1004;I can rest in the afterlife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1005;Her hair is always perfect, men love her charm and looks but she is also intelligent and well-spoken. She has been blessed with beauty, intelligence and success in all things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1005;Why was [Root.GetSheHe] blessed and not I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1005;It's hard not to envy her, but I am perfect as I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1006;It feels like everyone is trying to trump me! My huntsman killed more prey than I, my councillors found a better solution to the rebellious peasants than mine and I started to feel that everyone was better than me, no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1006;If they are better than me, then I have to accept that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1006;I envy them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1007;Tonight, while walking around the castle in the darkness, unnoticed, I overheard one of our courtiers speaking very badly of me in front of some servants. The criticism stung harder than it should have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1007;I will have my revenge! Arrest him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1007;Sooner or later he will regret this by himself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1008;I took a good look at myself and thought about my weaknesses and strengths. After many hours spent in deep thoughts, I realized that...:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1008;I have nothing to be ashamed of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1008;I have many strengths, but more weaknesses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1009;It was one of those situations where you did not want to tell the truth in case it would hurt the person, but in the same time, honesty is a virtue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1009;Lie, and don't hurt anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1009;Be honest, and tell it as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3220;I believe I can do great things, therefore I have put my mind to actually implement my ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3220;I am right to be proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312930;I have finally fought my enemies in battle for the first time. I have gained the Veteran trait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312930;I did well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312931;I have led my men to another great victory in battle!\nI have proved my bravery and tactical cunning once more, and earned the respect and loyalty of my warriors on the field.\nI have gained the Victorious Warrior trait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312931;I did well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312932;During the years of my youth I have been fervently trained in the 'Ars Bellica' by the principles of ancient Roman traditions and practices. All in war is about training, order, discipline, and relentlessly rational planning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312932;Good. I will soon prove my worth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
