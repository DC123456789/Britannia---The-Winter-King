EVTNAMECOEL2;Death of Coel Hen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCOEL2;The great Coel Hen, Dux Brittanniarum, Imperator of the North, and ruler of Hen Ogledd, has died. Though he was granted his realm legitimately by the Emperor Magnus Maximus before he left to claim the imperial throne in Gaul, the claims of his sons to continue their dynastic rule over the land is somewhat tenuous. As the land is divided up between them, the idea of a unified North is becoming more of a distant memory than anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTACOEL2;The North will remain strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCOEL2;Perhaps this is our chance for power and independence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCCOEL2;A great leader has died!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
