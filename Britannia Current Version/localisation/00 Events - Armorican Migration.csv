EVTDESC301002;As war, disease, and the Anglo-Saxon invasion ravage Britannia, Britons are leaving the island in huge numbers and settling in Armorica. A significant Brythonic settlement has now sprung up in [Root.GetName] as the Britons seek a safer place to call home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301002_1;The Brythonic settlement in [Root.GetName] has ballooned as Britons continue to flee Britannia in huge numbers, crossing the British Sea and settling in our lands.
