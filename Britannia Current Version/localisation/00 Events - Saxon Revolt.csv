EVTNAMEREVOLT1;An Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCREVOLT1;Weakened by years of infighting and civil war, the British kingdoms are now more vulnerable than ever. We could take advantage of the situation by urging Saxons everywhere to rise up in a revolt, the likes of which have never before been seen on these isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAREVOLT1;The Saxons will rise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBREVOLT1;No they won't...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEREVOLT2;Unrest Among the Foederati;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCREVOLT2;The recent bout of warring between the British kingdoms has led to a worrying reduction in supplies and coin available with which to pay the Saxon foederati. There is worry that they may revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAREVOLT2;We should be wary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEREVOLT3;A Revolt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCREVOLT3;The recent warring between the British kingdoms has meant that our payment of supplies and coin has trickled to a stop. There is word among the Saxons settlements that a revolt is coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAREVOLT3;Now is our chance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEREVOLT4;The Great Saxon Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCREVOLT4;The British have failed to provide us with our promised payment in return for our loyal services - now we will take what is rightfully ours, through blood and iron!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAREVOLT4;These islands shall be ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEREVOLT5;The Great Saxon Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCREVOLT5;The Saxon foederati of the British kingdoms have declared open revolt on their former masters. Dismayed at the failure to provide them with sufficient payment, the German soldiers have begun ravaging the countryside, seizing land and settlements along the Thames valley. Who knows how much more they will seek in lieu of payment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAREVOLT5;Rise my brothers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBREVOLT5;Bloodthirsty savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEREVOLT6;We are Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCREVOLT6;The continued revolt against the British Kingdoms has allowed us to seize land along the Thames valley. The British are so exhausted that they are unable to put up any resistance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAREVOLT6;We are mighty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEREVOLT7;Saxons Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCREVOLT7;Unable to put up any more resistance to the continued revolt of the Saxons, the British have been forced to withdraw from the southern half of the Thames valley, and the Saxons now have full control over the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAREVOLT7;One day we will take these lands back;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEREVOLT8;The Saxon Plague;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCREVOLT8;The dreaded Saxon Plague, brought over by the invading foreigners, has resigned you to your bed. Perhaps you are not long for this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAREVOLT8;I feel awful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
