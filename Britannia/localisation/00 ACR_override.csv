immortal_mystic_nestor_a;You expected a wrinkled old man, and the alleged mystic standing before you is that, to a degree. The man who introduces himself as [From.GetFirstName] has an undeniably youthful energy. His voice is as smooth as honey and his smile charms all it shines upon. You invite him to dine with you and his conversation is most intriguing. He claims to hold the secrets to eternal life and vitality and offers to teach you more, if you are willing to accept his quest.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know if this old man speaks the truth, at least he seems very lively for his apparent age. But is he immortal...?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You are [Root.GetFirstName]," [From.GetSheHe] says, as if somebody had forgotten to introduce you. Perhaps you should have spoken the first words, to assert your position, but the muscular [From.GetManWoman] makes you more than a little nervous. \n\n"I hear you are looking to live forever," [From.GetSheHe] finally says, more a statement than question. "I can help.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
