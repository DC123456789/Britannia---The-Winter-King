claim_imperium_britannicum_410;Form the Imperium Britanniarum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_imperium_britannicum_410_desc;Britannia will never survive the coming storms if it remains divided into feuding petty kingdoms. Once enough of the island recognizes us as High King, we will be in a position to declare ourselves Imperator and restore a strong central government - though the self-proclaimed kings and warlords are unlikely to take this well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_imperium_britannicum_410_tooltip;Many of your §YSubject Kingdoms§! are likely to revolt against your rule. If victorious, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] will be proclaimed Imperator and vassalize all current §YSubject Kingdoms§!, restoring an §YImperial§! government and losing the §YDecaying Realm§! modifier. If defeated, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] will be forced to relinquish the High Kingship, and will never be allowed to reclaim it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_empire_romanized_germanic;Claim the Imperial Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_empire_romanized_germanic_desc;The Empire of the West in Rome is no more. While some pretentious Romans still scoff at our "barbarian" origins, it cannot be denied that our kingdom remains a bastion of Roman civilization in this new era. If we were to unify enough of Gaul under our rule, we would perhaps have the prestige and legitimacy to crown ourselves as the new and restored Imperator...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_empire_romanized_germanic_tooltip;The Empire is reborn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HK_claim_britannia;Claim the High Kingdom of Britannia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HK_claim_britannia_desc;A powerful enough king who holds one of the traditional kingdoms of Britain can claim the vacant §YHigh Kingdom of Britannia§! for himself. All other kings will be informed and will have to decide whether to support the claimant, or to dispute his right to rule as High King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HK_britannia_formalize_high_kingship;Formalize the High Kingship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HK_britannia_formalize_high_kingship_desc;The High Kingship is a great honour to those deemed worthy of the title, but is still largely an informal distinction subject to the whims and goodwill of the other kings. However, now that our dynasty has ruled as High King for generations, many are coming to see the existence of a High King as normal, and it might be possible to convene a council to formalize the title and entrench the position. Perhaps this will only be the first step in unifying the many kingdoms of Britannia under a truly united state...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HK_britannia_formalize_high_kingship_tooltip;The §YHigh Kingdom of Britannia§! will no longer be lost on succession, desposition, or if the reigning High King becomes too weak, and can now be properly inherited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HK_britannia_establish_central_mint;Establish a Central Mint;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HK_britannia_establish_central_mint_desc;Britannia has had no source of coinage since the collapse of the Roman administration, but if we were to establish a mint in our capital, we could use the land's rich mineral reserves to strike our own coinage - in the High King's name and image, of course - and revive trade and economic links across the island. This just might be the excuse we need to collect contributions from the other kings in order to run the mint, allowing us to effectively start taxing them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HK_britannia_empower_the_high_council;Empower the High Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HK_britannia_empower_the_high_council_desc;As the High King we are nominally recognized as suzerain over all of Britannia but in reality we have little power beyond the borders of our realm. While a recognized High Council does exist it is currently little more than a talking shop with little real authority. If we could convince the council to make its decisions legally binding - with the military force to back it up - this could give us the legal leverage to assert our authority more strongly, though many of our Subject Kings are likely to rebel against this infringement of their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HK_britannia_empower_the_high_council_tooltip;Many of your §YSubject Kingdoms§! are likely to revolt against you. If victorious, all current §YSubject Kingdoms§! will become formal vassals of [Root.GetTitledFirstName], and you will be granted the right to press §YDe Jure Claims§! and §YSubjugate§! independent kings within the de jure borders of Britannia.

HK_britannia_centralize_the_church_desc_christian;The see of Londinium has been vacant since the fall of the old Roman capital of Londinium to the Saxons, leaving the church in Britannia largely disorganized. Now that the city is back in proper British hands, we are in a position to revive the see and restore the archbishopric to its traditional place at the head of the British church - under the protection and patronage of the High King, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HK_britannia_centralize_the_church_desc_pagan;The cross-worshippers of Rome are the enemies of any good [Root.Religion.GetName] pagan, but it cannot be denied that their strong church organization and hierarchy has been immensely useful for Catholic monarchs to exert their control over their realm. If we could replicate this sort of structure among our own [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s - with the top of the hierarchy reporting to the High King - this could go a long way towards further centralizing power away from that of the individual kings into our own hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HK_britannia_formalize_succession_desc;While there has been a tendency for the High Kingship to be hereditary the title has always been and is still officially elected from among all of the traditional kings. With the support of the church for our dynasty's continued rule and the approval of our vassal kings, we could arrange for the formal election and investment of our successor during the current High King's reign, ensuring that our favoured successor is chosen and instituting a de facto rule of hereditary succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This great company of warriors will swear fealty to you, and take an oath to always fight for Britannia against foreign invaders. If ever granted independence, they will fight honorably for any Briton or Romano-British king defending against foreigners, and they will never ask for gold in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
