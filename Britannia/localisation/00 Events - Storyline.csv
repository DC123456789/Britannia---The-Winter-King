EVTNAME312140;The Plague of Justinian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312140;The dreaded pandemic disease known as the 'Plague of Justinian', which has struck and weakened the Eastern Roman Empire during the past few years, has at last reached the coasts of Gaul.\n\nThe terrible plague first broke out in Constantinople in 541 AD, and a few months later it had killed almost half of the city's inhabitants. People fled in terror, spreading the disease to ports around the whole known world.\n\nA few days ago, the bubonic plague has claimed its first victim in the province of [Root.Location.GetName], and a dark fear is already spreading among the populace of the neighbouring lands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312140;This is troubling news, but nothing can be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312140;This is the wrath of God! Sinners and pagans will be doomed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312140;The curse of the Gods is upon us! We shall offer a great sacrifice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD312140;We shall be rational and do what we can to prevent an outbreak...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD312140TT;Orders will be given to take any possible measure to limit the spreading of the plague: anyone showing the signs of the disease will be isolated, infected areas will be contained, the trade of linen or woollen goods will be restricted, and the burial of corpses anywhere near the town or castle walls will be strictly forbidden.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312150;Anglo-Saxons Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312150;After a centuries-long series of wars and campaigns, the last remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and hosts have finally been defeated and evicted from the island of Britannia. While some Saxon settlers still remain on the island under their new overlords, the dream of an Anglo-Saxon "Ænglaland" has been brought to a definitive end.\n\nWith the Ingvaeonic tribes on the mainland seemingly showing little interest in continuing the attempts, the island of Britannia can finally rest easily, free from the constant threat of foreign invasions. Though there are those who still carefully watch the Oceanus Germanicus, ever wary that one day, warhosts will land on the eastern shore of Britannia once more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA312150;Good riddance. Let them flee back across the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312150;Mark my words...! We will rise again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312150;Pah! Who cares about that forsaken isle anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD312150;Weaklings. We can do better than that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE312150;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312220;The Siege of Ynys Trebes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312220;The armies of the Franks have sieged and conquered the tidal island of Ynys Trebes. The royal family of Benoic has managed to escape the palace and leave the island aboard fishing boats, while the Frankish warriors were climbing the harbour's stone quay and swarming into the city. The great library of Ynys Trebes has been set on fire: centuries of human knowledge and literature are now forever lost to the flames.\n\nThe former King of Benoic and his family fled to Britain, hoping to find refuge at some British ruler's court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312220;They abandoned their people to death and slavery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312220;We shouldn't have let them escape...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312220;Escape was our only chance of survival!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312221;We managed to escape the siege of Ynys Trebes and fled to Britain aboard fishing boats. The Franks have sacked the city and set the royal palace and the library on fire. Centuries of human knowledge and literature are now forever lost to the flames...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

########## FRANKS ##########
EVTNAME313200;The Frankish Invasion of Soissons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313200;Ever since the Crossing of the Rhine decades ago, the Roman Empire has been raided, beseiged, and ultimately destroyed by hordes of Germanic invaders intent on conquest. Only the Domain of Soissons in Northern Gaul survived the conquests, forging alliances with the Franks to defend this Roman rump state from other invaders intent on conquering this rich land. \n\nBut now, Childeric of the Franks, the great ally of the Syagrii in Soissons, is dead. The new king, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] of the Franks, has no such alliance or friendship with the Romans and has declared an invasion of Soissons, claiming it for his own, a war that will decide the fate of Gaul and all of Western Europe forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313200;We will show those Romans who is powerful now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313200;No, perhaps those Romans will be useful later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313200;Excellent! We will soon rule over these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313200;This is worrying news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313200;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313201;The Frankish War on Benoic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313201;Thousands of Frankish warriors are assembling outside the walls of [Root.Capital.GetName]. According to rumors, the King of the Franks is preparing to march to war against the Armorican kingdom of Benoic.\n\nFrankish warbands have been sighted in the wooden hills of central Benoic, hiding during the day and coming out at night like packs of wolves to sack, pillage and burn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313201;Benoic will be crushed and Ynys Trebes shall burn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313201;No, perhaps those Amoricans will be useful later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313201;Excellent! We will soon rule over these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313201;They are a fearsome and powerful enemy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313201;Interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313203;The Frankish War on the Visigoths;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313203;For years, tensions between the expansionist Franks and the Visigoths to the south have been rising, as the two great Germanic kingdoms feud over supremacy of Gaul. As the Franks cement their control over the newly conquered Northern Gaul, the Visigoths look on in concern, worrying that they will be the next target of the seemingly unstoppable Frankish expansion- and rightfully so. \n\nNow, sensing weakness and division in the Kingdom of the Visigoths, [Root.GetFirstName], King of the Franks, has declared an invasion and marched into Visigothic territory, claiming all of Gaul as his own. As the Visigoths defend prepare to defend their land, all watch to see who will emerge dominant over Gaul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313203;The Visigoths will be destroyed, for all of Gaul is ours to take!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313203;No, perhaps those Visigoths will be useful later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313203;Excellent! We will soon rule over these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTE313203;Interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313204;The Frankish Invasion of Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313204;After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Burgundians maintained an alliance, if shaky, with the Franks to the north, with the two Germanic kingdoms supporting each other as they expanded at the expense of the Romans and Goths. However, as the Franks continued to grow and become more and more powerful, mercilessly conquering and destroying their neighbours, relations began to sour as the Franks became drawn into the various conflicts within the royal family. \n\nNow, after several raids and skirmishes between the two kingdoms, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has finally invaded with the intention of conquering the entire kingdom. Now, the Burgundians must make their stand or be destroyed and absorbed into the realms of the Franks, like so many before them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313204;The treacherous Burgundians will be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313204;No, perhaps those Burgundians will be useful later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313204;Excellent! We will soon rule over these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313204;They are a fearsome and powerful enemy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313204;Interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313205;The Frankish Invasion of Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313205;With the start of the Gothic War, Ostrogothic forces have been largely withdrawn from Provence for the defence of Italia, leaving the Praetorian Prefecture of Gaul to fend for itself. Seeking an opportunity, [Root.GetTitledName] has laid claim to the area and declared war, seeking the riches of Provence for [Root.GetHerselfHimself].\n\nAs the prefect desperately gathers what militias and forces he can muster, an enormous Frankish host prepares to bear down on the largely undefended province. It may be only a matter of time before the period of Ostrogothic dominion in Gaul is put to a definitive end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313205;The Ostrogoths would be no match for us anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313205;Excellent! We will soon rule over these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313205;They are a fearsome and powerful enemy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313205;Interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313206;The Frankish Invasion of Alemannia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313206;Continuous tensions and raids between the Franks and Alemanni along their shared border have finally come to a head and broken into all-out war. Vowing to break the power of the Alemanni once and for all, [Root.GetTitledName] has raised a large army and launched an invasion of the Alemannic heartland.\n\nThe Alemanni were once among the fiercest and most tenacious enemies of Rome, but now face a threat of a completely different kind. It remains to see if the Alemanni will be able to successfully defend their treasured independence, or if the strength of the Franks is simply too much to bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313206;Let us bring the light of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] to those barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313206;Excellent! We will soon rule over these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313206;They are a fearsome and powerful enemy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313206;Interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313240;Defeat of the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313240;The fearsome Frankish tribes that occupied much of Roman Germania and Belgica in the Empire's moments of weakness have finally been decisively defeated. Their petty kingdoms carved out of Roman land have been subjugated or destroyed, and the Frankish nobility has either bent down to Roman overlordship once more or fled across the old Roman frontier into Magna Germania. While independent Frankish lords still rule in their ancestral lands across the Rhine, never again will the Franks pose such a grave threat to the heart of Gaul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313240;Rome has prevailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313240;At last, those barbarians have been defeated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313240;We have not be defeated! We will return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313240;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313241;Rise of the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313241;It seems that the return of Roman dominance over Gaul was not to be. The Frankish tribes have mustered their fearsome warriors and poured over the Limes Germanicus once more, overrunning the Roman defences of the Rhine and reoccupying the northeastern provinces of Gaul. Parts of Belgica and northern Germania are once again under the rule of Frankish kings, and cities and courts of Gaul are rife with concern. \n\nWith the Franks on the rise once more, the fate of Gaul once more hangs on a precipice. Will the Franks finally be able to assert their dominance over the many province of Gaul? Or will the Romans prevail against the Germanic invaders once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313241;Gaul will be ours, once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313241;The barbarians will be defeated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313241;This is worrying news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313241;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313261;The Free Town of Caletum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313261;The rich and powerful sailor merchants of Caletum, displeased by the intolerable taxes imposed on their trades by their feudal lord, have quietly plotted against him and successfully removed him from power.\n\nAfter having obtained control over the town and its prosperous portual market, the merchants have proclaimed self-jurisdiction and formally declared the birth of the 'Commune of Caletum'.\n\nA powerful local trader, [From.Liege.GetFirstName], is currently the highest civil authority and 'de facto' ruler of the province. Under the title of [From.Liege.GetTitledName], he has sworn fealty to [From.Liege.Liege.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313261;Merchants? Is this happening for real?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313261;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313270;Uniting the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313270;We Franks would be stronger united, and little comes of quarelling amongst ourselves. We have sent emissaries to all the other Frankish kings, inviting them to swear fealty to us or face our wrath. Might makes right, and all Franks will soon learn of your superior skill and strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313270;We will bring them all under our fold, one way or another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP313270;Emissaries are sent to all the other Frankish kings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313271;Uniting the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313271;An emissary has arrived from [From.GetTitledName]. He heaps praise upon our prestige amongst the Frankish nation, poetically imploring us to share in his liege's greater vision. Whilst he speaks of the great things the Franks could do united, he also warns confidently of the great force that will be raised against us if we do not submit. Your hall falls deathly silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313271;The Franks will be stronger united.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313271;I will not bow to this upstart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313272;Uniting the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313272;Your emmissary returns with a wagon of tribute, and a spring in his step. [From.GetTitledName] has acknowledged you as his new suzerain, and will serve your greater Frankish realm forthwith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313272;Excellent. He has made a wise choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313273;Uniting the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313273;Your emmisary has returned empty handed from [From.GetTitledName], his hair having been cut to the scalp and sporting one less ear than he had when he departed. [From.GetTitledName] has scorned your demand to join the greater Frankish realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313273;How dare [From.GetSheHe]?!? To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313273;We will deal with [From.GetHerHim] later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313274;Unification of the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313274;In past times, the disunity of the Germanic tribes lining the Roman Empire has been their greatest weakness. Never before has the ambition of any one ruler been enough to challenge the might of Rome, but no longer. The Franks are now fully united, both Salian and Ripuarian, and the might of [Root.GetTitledName] is spoken of with fear all across western Europe. In Gaul the remnants of Rome and even the other Germanic kingdoms beyond regard [Root.GetTitledName] with trepidation, and rightly so. The rise of the Franks shows no signs of stopping. United under a common banner, the power of the Franks may well be enough to topple Roman rule once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313274;All of Gaul will tremble under my name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313274;May [Root.GetTitledName] bring glory to the Franks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313274;This is worrying news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313274;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313276;An Ultimatum Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313276;An emissary has arrived from [From.GetTitledName] with a rather alarming demand. Accusing you and your court of all sorts of lecherous deeds and unforgivable slights against against [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetBestName] demands that we give up our kingdom and submit fully to [From.GetHerHis] rule, or face war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313276;I suppose we have no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313276;This is an outrage! Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313277;Demand Accepted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313277;Much to your surprise, [From.GetTitledName] has accepted the terms of your ultimatum, and has essentially delivered [From.GetHerHis] entire kingdom over to your control. The emissary offers many humble apologies on behalf of [From.GetFirstName], and entreats you to treat [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] family with mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313277;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313278;Demand Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313278;Your emissary has arrived rather worse for wear, the victim of [From.GetTitledName]'s rage at your accusations and demands. [From.GetTitledName] has cut off all ties and alliances, and it seems that there will not be a peaceful resolution to the problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313278;Well, this will be a quick war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313280;The Danish March;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313280;Fearing the growing power and the destructive raids of the Norse, [Root.GetTitledName] has declared the creation of the 'Danish March' on the lands between the Eider and the Schlei. The newly created march has been incorporated into the Kingdom of Saxony and will be heavily fortified and garrisoned, to serve as a first line of defence for the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] in the north.\n\n Already the Vikings are testing the march's defences, raiding its lands and attacking its castles. Time will tell if this fortified borderland will truly be able to protect the Danish border...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313280;The barbarians will not pass!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313280;Ha! This 'march' will not keep us out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313280;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313290;The Merovingian Guard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313290;With the fall of the Merovingian dynasty, the traditional armed retinue of the Frankish kings has no rightful liege to serve. Their commander, [Root.GetFirstName], has decided to reform his ranks and convert the former royal guard into an independent mercenary company. They will be known as 'Frankish Fœderati'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313290;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
########## PICTS ##########
EVTNAME314920;War in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314920;Thousands of Pictish warriors from the highland tribes of the north are gathering in the valleys of Scotia. They swore fealty to the [Root.GetTitledName], and in return they expect to be sent to conquer new lands for themselves south of Antonine's Wall.\n\nThe neighbouring kingdoms shall prepare to defend themselves from these fierce blue painted warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314920;We will conquer and rule those lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB314920;They must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC314920;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
########## IRISH AND GAELS ##########
EVTNAME314943;Gaelic Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314943;A large number of Gaelic warriors have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], hoping to take part in the plunder and glory in the conquests against the Picts. They are eager to fight under your banner, but should you stay put for too long they may soon grow restless and impatient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314943;Excellent! We will soon be ruling over Dunadd!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME314944;Gaelic Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314944;Hearing of your recent successes against the Picts, another large number of Gaelic warriors have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], hoping to take part in the plunder and glory in your continued conquests. They are eager to fight under your banner, but should you stay put for too long they may soon grow restless and impatient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314944;Excellent! We will soon be ruling over Scotia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314945;The warriors gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName] in hopes of glory in riches have grown disillusioned by your continued refusal to go to war. They have returned to your homes and your reputation has suffered greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314945;At least they did not turn against us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314946;Following the conquest of [Root.GetName], many Gaelic warriors have settled in the province with their families. The local Picts are slowly adopting the culture of their conquerors, and [Root.GetName] is becoming more Gaelic day by day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314946;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
########## VISIGOTHS ##########
EVTNAME301200;The Fall of Aquitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301200;Crisis has struck our kingdom, as province after province falls to the Franks, even our former capital of Tolosa. However, though our armies have been driven out of Aquitania, the country is still thickly inhabited by Visigoths and pro-Gothic Roman nobles suspicious of their new Frankish overlords that maintain significant sympathy to our cause. However, this support will not last forever. We must strike a blow against the Franks and retake the southern provinces of Aquitania, or our adopted homeland will be forever lost to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301200;We will reconquer Aquitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP301200;We will gain a casus belli to reconquer the whole region of Southern Aquitania against anyone holding territory there. If we do not complete the conquest within 40 years, however, the dream of recovering Aquitania will fade away and we will lose access to this casus belli.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301201;Reconquest of Southern Aquitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301201;The armies of the Visigoths have made great strides, taking back the provinces of Novempopulania as well as the region around our former capital of Tolosa. Now is the time to strike the final blow against the Franks and reconquer all of Aquitania, our rightful territory stolen from us years earlier. However, though our earlier victories have bought us time and support, this support will not last forever. Should our offensives and momentum stall, our support will fade and the rest of our adopted homeland will be forever lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301201;We will reconquer Aquitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP301201;We will gain a casus belli to reconquer the remainder of Aquitania against anyone holding territory there. If we do not complete the conquest within 40 years, however, the dream of recovering Aquitania will fade away and we will lose access to this casus belli.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301209;Reconquest of Aquitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301209;The armies of the Franks have been shattered, and we have been able to bring all of Aquitania under our control once more. Visigothic rule now properly extends from Hispania to the Liger, as the proper Visigothic administration is restored to the people of Aquitania. As the barbarian Franks retreat the northern Gaul to lick their wounds, they have hopefully been taught an important lesson about challenging the iron strength of the Visigoths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301209;They will not return. Aquitania is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
########## OSTROGOTHS ##########
EVTNAME302801;Rise of the Ostrogoths;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302801;[ostrogothic_king.GetTitledFirstName] of the Ostrogoths has emerged victorious in Italy following the murder of the former King Odoacer and his supporters in Ravenna during a banquet celebrating a peace treaty. All of Italy now lies firmly under the control of [ostrogothic_king.GetTitledFirstName], who has taken power as an ostensible viceroy of the Emperor and has promised to continue to respect the rights and administrations of his new Roman subjects.\n\nThe king has nonetheless expressed his desire to restore order and unity over the fractured West, pursuing marriage alliances with the various other Germanic kings. While the Ostrogoths seem content to rule over Italy for now, a sudden shift in the political environment - especially in Provence - could change that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302801;They are all barbarians anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB302801;Truly, the age of the Goths has begun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC302801;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME302803;The Gothic War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302803;A great war has broken out in Italy. Flush from his success in the conquest of the Vandal kingdom of Africa, [eastern_roman_emperor.GetTitledName] has directed his great general Belisarius to reconquer the provinces of Italy for the empire. Already Sicily and Dalmatia have fallen to the Roman armies, who are now marching through southern Italy towards Rome itself.\n\nOstrogothic armies have been withdrawn from Provence as they mount a desperate defence against the Romans, leaving the Praetorian Prefecture of Gaul to its fate. As Roman citizens defect to the empire and Ostrogothic nobles feud over the kingship abdicated by the former king [ostrogothic_king.GetFirstName], it seems that the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths is nearing its end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Already Sicily and Dalmatia have fallen to the Roman armies, who are now marching through southern Italy towards Rome itself.\n\nThe Ostrogothic kingdom has been thrown into complete disarray, with Roman citizens attempting to defect to the empire and the former King [ostrogothic_king.GetFirstName] overthrown by furious Ostrogothic nobles even as they regroup in the north. It seems only a matter of time before the Ostrogoths fall as the next victim of [eastern_roman_emperor.GetFirstName]'s reconquests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302803;It seems that we are on our own then...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME302805;End of the Gothic War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302805;The Gothic War is over. The Gothic resurgence from 540 onwards nearly drove the Romans out of Italy while distracted in the East, but ultimately to no avail as the general Narses returned with a massive army. The last Ostrogothic king [ostrogothic_king.GetFirstName] was slain making his last stand near Mount Vesuvius, and with him the Kingdom of Ostrogoths ended, bringing to an end the 19 devastating years of war.\n\nWhile [eastern_roman_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] has proudly proclaimed the return of the mother city of Rome to the Empire, the cities of Italy lie devastated by the many years of war, and the overstretched Empire reels from the costs of his constant campaigns. It seems unlikely that there will be more campaigns to the west in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302805;The end of an era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB302805;Let us hope for a lasting peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME302811;The Ostrogothic Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302811;War is brewing in the southeast of Gaul. [Root.GetTitledName] has declared war on [From.Holder.TopLiege.GetTitledName], claiming the need to restore order in the region in the wake of the fall of Visigothic Provence. A large Ostrogothic army has been spotted crossing the border into the province of [From.GetName], making its way to the city of Arelate.\n\nThe extent of [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s ambitions in Gaul remain to be seen, though many say [Root.GetSheHe] will not be content with simply a buffer zone in the south. The rulers of Gaul would be well advised to shore up their defences and watch this new player on the political scene closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302811;Outrageous! Provence is [This.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] territory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB302811;We should be wary of his motives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME302813;Conquest of Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302813;The armies of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] have been defeated, and the Ostrogoths now stand triumphant over the lands of Provence. Wasting no time in reorganizing the area, [From.GetTitledName] has proclaimed the restoration of the defunct Praetorian Praefecture of Gaul and has appointed [Root.GetFullName] as the new prefect in [Root.Capital.GetName] to administer the newly conquered provinces.\n\nAs [From.GetTitledName] looks to secure his control over the newly conquered territory, rumours swirl in the courts of Gaul about [From.GetHerHis] next move. All eyes are now carefully watching the Ostrogoths, waiting to see if they will return to Italy in triumph or if they harbour further ambitions in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME302816;A Demand from the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302816;Following their successes in Provence, an emissary from [ostrogothic_king.GetTitledName] has arrived in our court. He speaks of 'Gothic solidarity' and promises to help us regain our Gallic territories, reminding us of the many Ostrogothic soldiers currently stationed in Arelate, if we agree to a... 'greater role' for [ostrogothic_king.GetTitledFirstName] in our administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302816;He is our only hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302816TT_1;§Y[ostrogothic_king.GetTitledFirstName]§! vassalizes all titles in §YProvence§! belonging to §Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB302816;We will never bow down to his ilk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME302818;Submission of the Visigoths;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302818;In a major diplomatic coup, [Root.GetTitledName] has successfully pressured the Visigoths into having himself appointed regent of the realm, granting him major powers over and above even [From.GetTitledFirstName] [From.GetHerselfHimself]. The Visigothic kingdom has now been essentially subordinated into a tributary state of the Ostrogoths, who now effectively rule from Italia to Hispania. \n\nAs part of the agreement, however, [Root.GetTitledName] has also reportedly promised military aid to help the Visigoths recover some of their lost Gallic provinces. With a large Ostrogothic army still stationed in Arelate, many in Gaul are looking warily at this new Gothic alliance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302818;Order will be restored to the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME302819;Invasion of the Visigoths;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302819;Negotiations between the Ostrogoths and Visigoths over the status of Provence and Ostrogothic influence in Visigothic affairs have broken down. The Visigoths have rebuffed a final Ostrogothic ultimatum to appoint [Root.GetTitledName] regent, and war has broken out in the south of Gaul once more. \n\nSpeaking of the need to 'restore order' to the 'chaotic and unstable' Visigothic realm, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has ordered the great Ostrogothic host in Arelate to march on the remaining Visigothic territories and forcibly subjugate the Visigoths to [Root.GetHerHis] rule. The Ostrogoths are on the warpath once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302819;We gave them a choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB302819;Let them come and fight us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME302820;Subjugation of the Visigoths;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302820;Defeated on the field of battle, the Visigoths have been forced to make a favourable peace with the Ostrogoths, surrendering their claims to Provence and acceding to their earlier demands. [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has been forced to appoint [Root.GetTitledName] as regent over the realm, who now effectively controls the Visigothic kingdom as a tributary state.\n\nWhile many fear [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s next move, it appears that [Root.GetSheHe] seems to be satisfied with [Root.GetHerHis] ambitions in Gaul for now and has ordered the bulk of [Root.GetHerHis] army back to Italia. It appears, however, that the Ostrogoths are here to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
