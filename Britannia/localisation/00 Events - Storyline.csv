EVTDESC312130;As regent, most of Dumnonia supports you, but not all.

But Princess Guinevere of the lost kingdom, Henis Wyren, radiates an aura of destiny. She will marry a great man, and thinks you are one, despite your bastardry. Will you put the interests of Dumnonia aside, for a woman who sets your heart aflame?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC312131;In a surprising move, the famed warrior Arthur, [Root.GetArthurTitle], has announced his marriage to your courtier Guinevere, daughter of the dispossessed King Leodegan of Henis Wyren. Apparently, he spurned many other more wealthy and connected princesses for this choice, so great was his his love and yearning for Guinevere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312131_1;The great Arthur might be unparalleled among men, but he has never faced a woman like yourself versed in the ways of romance and seduction. Indeed, a smile here, a wink there, and now Arthur is practically begging you to marry him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA312132;But... but why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312133;You were shocked when Ceinwyn ran off and disappeared at her wedding - you had always known that she was stubborn, but not that she was capable of something like this!

EVTDESC312133_1;From the moment you first saw Derfel Cadarn you knew you two were meant to be together.

EVTDESC312134_1;You were in love the moment you laid your eyes on her, but you knew that a lowly soldier like you never had a chance with the brilliant Ceinwyn, the Star of Powys.

EVTDESC313101;King Aelle of Anglia has taken his last breath, and thus his rule over Anglia has ended. His claim to the title of Bretwalda held together the diverse tribes of Angles and Saxons in their struggle to carve out a homeland - now his death now heralds a bleaker period and more divided period for the Saxon peoples. Across his former lands his vassals now reject the new king, preferring to look in amongst themselves for strength. Though these rebellious types seek to be kings in their own right, it is possible still that his heir will earn his rule once more through strength and cunning, bringing the rebellious sorts to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313101;Anglia must remain strong, in honour of the great king!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313101;Perhaps this is our chance for power and independence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313101;A great king and warrior has died...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313101;Perhaps this will stop the barbarians' advance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313101;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313103;The Deposition of Aelle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313103;Aelle of Anglia has been cast from his throne, and thus his rule of Anglia has ended. His claim to the title of Bretwalda having made him the greatest King of the Saxon Shore, he now lives destitute, his legacy the mockery of those who have taken his crown. His fall has opened up divisions amongst the Saxons, and now his former vassals squabble amongst one another, unable to agree the legitimacy of the new King. Now looking in amongst themselves for strength, new rebels in Anglia are ignoring the rule of law that Aelle had upheld, though it is possible that his successor will earn his rule once more through strength and cunning, bringing the rebellious sorts to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313103;A new era begins in Anglia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313103;Perhaps this is our chance for power and independence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313103;A great king is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313103;Perhaps this infighting will stop the barbarians' advance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313103;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313104;Under Aelle, Anglia was a strong and unified kingdom, but now the kingdom is fraught with division. Vassals are scheming left and right and some have even directly questioned your rights to the Kingdom of Anglia. It is only a matter of time before present a direct challenge to your power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313104;We must stop this before it gets out control!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313105;Unlike his predecessor Aelle, [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] has failed to gain the confidence of the vassals he rules over, and many are beginning to question his authority over the Kingdom of Anglia. Many of them have banded together to declare their independence, not recognizing him as their true overlord, and have invited you to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313105;This is an excellent opportunity for independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313105;[Root.Liege.GetFirstName] is the rightful king of Anglia and our rightful overlord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313106;A large number of disaffected Anglian warriors have gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName], promising to help you in your fight for independence against the King of Anglia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313106;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313107;Fall of Anglia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313107;Once a great Anglo-Saxon kingdom and one of the most powerful realms in Britannia, the Kingdom of Anglia has fallen to internal infighting. Unable to keep the kingdom together, King [Root.GetName] has been defeated by his vassals and forced to abdicate from the throne, dissolving the kingdom.\n\nWithout a unifying realm ruling over them all, the different groups within the former kingdom have begun to form new national identities. The East Saxons to the south are establishing their own identity independent of Anglia while the Angles settled in the west are beginning to consider themselves "Mercians", and only the East Angles still consider themselves part of Anglia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313107;We will remember their treachery...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313107;The Anglian domination has ended! It is time for us to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313107;Hah! Let the barbarians fight among themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313107;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313108;With no side gaining a clear advantage, you have agreed to a white peace and a truce with your vassals. While you have held your kingdom together for now, you have still not gained the respect of your vassals, and soon they could rise up once more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313108;We will must stay strong and vigilant against the traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313109;With neither side being truly defeated, we have agreed to a white peace and a truce with [Root.Liege.GetTitledName]. While Anglia remains under his yoke, he has not gained the confidence of his vassals, who are still scheming to gain their independence as soon as their truce ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313109;Next time we will succeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313110;Having decisively crushed your rebellious vassals on the battlefield, they have been forced to bend to your rule once more, and those who did not revolt have been quick to reaffirm their allegiance. You are now recognized as the undisputed King of Anglia, and those that opposed you are now completely at your mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313110;Excellent. Let that be an example to any else plotting against me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313111;Your forces have been crushed and you have been forced to kneel to [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] once more. With your bid for independence crushed, you have been forced to recognized as [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] your rightful overlord, and you are now completely at his mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313111;One day, we will be successful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### RISE OF BERNICIA ###
EVTNAME313120;Ultimatum to the Britons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313120;[Root.Capital.GetName] has been an Anglo-Saxon settlement for many years now, but it remains under the overlordship of the Briton kingdom of [Root.Liege.GetTitle]. However, as migration from the continent grows our strength we have been becoming increasingly dominant over the Britons here. We have now sent an ultimatum to [Root.Liege.GetTitledName], demanding that [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] cede control of the realm to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313120;It is time for the Angles to rule in Beornice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313120;No, it would be too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313121;Ultimatum from the Angles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313121;The Angles settled in [From.Capital.GetName] have sent us an ultimatum, demanding control over our entire kingdom of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Should we not acceed to their demands, they have also reminded us that they have many more warriors ready to fight than we do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313121;We have no choice but to submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313121;We will not give up what is rightfully ours!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313122;Rise of Beornice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313122;Recognizing our military superiority, [From.GetTitledName] has accepted our ultimatum and ceded control of the realm over to us. We are now in a position to declare independence and establish our own kingdom of Beornice, independent from our former British masters. [Root.GetRandomGodName] willing, we may soon be masters of all north of the Humber...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313122_1;The traitorious Angle foederati settled in Bryneich have deposed you and declared the creation the Kingdom of Beornice over your old realm of Linnius. The new Anglo-Saxon kingdom has quickly consolidated their control over the area, and have let the Cumbric citizens know that the Angles are the masters now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313122_2;The Angles settled in Bryneich have deposed the King of Bryneich and declared the creation the Kingdom of Beornice in its place. The new Anglo-Saxon kingdom, having rapidly consolidated their control over the area, refuses to swear fealty to us and could become a real threat in the future, as they may not be satisfied with just Bryneich...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313122_3;The Angles settled in Bryneich have deposed the King of Bryneich and declared the creation the Kingdom of Beornice in its place. The new Anglo-Saxon kingdom has quickly consolidated their control over the area, and as more settlers from the continent migrate to reinforce and strengthen the kingdom, the invulnerability of the Old North has been broken, paving the way for the rise of the Anglo-Saxons in the north...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313122_4;The Angles settled in Bryneich have deposed the King of Bryneich and declared the creation the Kingdom of Beornice in its place. The new Anglo-Saxon kingdom has quickly consolidated their control over the area, and now has the potential to pose a significant threat to all of the other kingdoms of Hen Ogledd. Other British kingdoms, especially the Kingdom of Ebrauc, worry about the loyalty of their own foederati - will they be next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313122;Excellent. Let the rule of the Angles commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313122;We will have our revenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313122;Cursed barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313122;Another Angle kingdom rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313122;This is extremely concerning...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313124;Ultimatum Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313124;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to accept our ultimatum and has even demanded that we submit and surrender immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313124;We will show the Wælisc who is powerful here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313124;Very well then. We have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313126;Anglian Foederati Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313126;Unwilling to let us take over peacefully, the Cumbrians have unwisely decided to resist our takeover of Bryneich, forcing us to take up arms to take what is ours. Once we have defeated the Cumbrians on the field of battle, we will be in a position to assert our dominance over these lands and establish an Angle kingdom of Beornice here on the coast of northern Britannia, independent of British rule or overlordship. Perhaps this will be the start of something more, as the lands north of the Humber beckon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313126_1;The foederati Angles have refused to submit and have instead declared war against us, intending to intending to take what they want by force. Their forces are rapidly mobilizing, and it seems that we have a fully fledged foederati revolt on our hands - one that will determine the fate of Bryneich, and perhaps all of the Old North...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313126_2;Our vassal, [From.GetTitledName], has informed us that the Angles of Bryneich have sent an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the realm. The ultimatum was dismissed, but the Angles have now mobilized against us, and they have now staged a fully fledged foederati revolt, intending to take control over the entirety of Bryneich...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313126_3;The foederati Angles settled in Bryneich have revolted against the King of Bryneich, after an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the realm was refused. War has broken out between the Britons and Angles in Bryneich, as the foederati rebel against their masters to establish dominance over the realm. \n\nShould the revolt succeed, this will be a major blow to the Britons of the north, possibly presenting a possibility for other Anglo-Saxon groups to rise up and establish their own rule...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313126_4;The foederati Angles settled in Bryneich have revolted against the King of Bryneich, after an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the realm was refused. War has broken out between the Britons and Angles in Bryneich, as the foederati rebel against their masters to establish dominance over the realm. \n\nThe fall of Bryneich would be a major blow for the Cumbrics of Hen Ogledd, exposing the northern flank of Britannia to Angle raids and invasions. Other British kingdoms - in particular the Kingdom of Ebrauc - are already watching their own foederati with concern...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313126;We shall be victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313126;To war! We will defend our lands from the barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313126;The barbarians will not take our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA313126;To war! We will defend our lands from the barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313127;Angles Back Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313127;The Angles have backed down on their ultimatum and submitted to your rule. [From.GetTitledName] has surrendered and is now imprisoned in your dungeon, at your mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313127;A wise choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313038_2;Rise of Beornice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313038_2;The Britons have been defeated and we now managed to gain control over much of the Bernician coast. With Anglo-Saxons now in control of the area, we are now in a position to create our own kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313038;The rule of the Angles begins today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME312155;An Anglo-Saxon Catholic King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The defensive structure is a statement of power, and will protect Anglo-Saxon lands from the native Britons still ruling in the deep valleys of Gwynedd and Powys.\n\nThis great barrier effectively seperates the Anglo-Saxon territories from the remaining British lands in the west, firmly dividing the island in two. With the loss of their heartlands, the Britons have now effectively ended the old elective system of Britannia, and now sturggle for dominance over the remaining lands that they call 'Cymru'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC301616;You have declared your intentional to found a new realm in Gaul, and a large number of adventerous warriors eager to fight for the riches of that land from your realm and beyond have begun to gather at your court.

### SCYLDING MIGRATION ###
EVTDESC301400;Preparations for the migration across the sea have begun, as our people pack up their livestock and belongings and gather near the fleet of ships we have constructed for the migration.

EVTNAME301410;Invasion of [angles_province.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301410;Having crossed the German Sea, we have chosen the Briton province of [angles_province.GetName] as our target, and our tribe and armies have landed and are quickly making their way to take control of the province.

EVTNAME301409;Angles Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301409;We have been defeated by the Britons once more, and this time we do not have the manpower to try again. Now, we must try to settle our tribe on more friendly lands - hopefully one of the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms will allow us to settle on their lands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME301417;Request for Settlement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301417;[From.GetFirstName], the former King of the Angles now leading his people in Nortwic, has come forward to you, requesting that you allow [From.GetHerHis] tribe to settle in your province of [angles_province.GetName]. [From.GetSheHe] has agreed to swear fealty to you in return, and [From.GetHerHis] tribe will quickly assimilate the current British majority there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301417;The province is yours to settle in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301417;No. This land is our land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301418;Settlement Granted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301418;[From.GetTitledName] has graciously granted us the right to settle in their province of [angles_province.GetName]. Our tribesmen are now settling in the province, setting up homesteads and forts as our people mix with and displace the native British populace. Our people have successfully crossed the sea, and we have managed to establish our own kingdom here in this new land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301418;A new home and a new era for our people...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301420;Failed Migration;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301420;Our attempts at conquest have failed, and none of our brethren are willing or able to give us land to settle our tribe in. Without any land to call home, our once-mighty nation has been forced to disperse, breaking up to try to find a home with whomever will take them, ending our dream of a new home in Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301420;We will not be forgotten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301425;After years of immigration and natural growth, the population of [Root.GetName] is beginning to recover from the nearly desolate province it once was.

EVTDESC301425_1;After years of immigration and natural growth, the population of [Root.GetName] has recovered significantly from the depopulations and migrations of the past.

### BERNICIAN MIGRATION ###
EVTDESC301440;We have sent an emissary to the King of Bryneich, offering him our services as foederati in his kingdom.

EVTOPTA301440;I am sure we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301441;Foederati Request;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301441;You have received an emissary from [From.GetTitledName] offering his services to you as foederati. His warbands and peoples would be of great use against the wretched Picts and Scots that have so ravaged our lands, though the tribulations of our cousins in Lloegyr serves as a stark warning of what could go wrong. Then again, the Saxons of the North have so far been quite docile and cooperative, so perhaps our foederati will not become an existential threat to us, and if we do not grant them land on our terms, they may take it from us on theirs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301441;We are in need of foederati.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME301443;Settlement Denied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301443;Our emissary has returned with the news that [From.GetTitledName] has refused our offer of foederati status, clearly fearing the fate of the Britons to the south.

EVTNAME313200;The Frankish Invasion of Soissons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313200;Ever since the Crossing of the Rhine decades ago, the Roman Empire has been raided, beseiged, and ultimately destroyed by hordes of Germanic invaders intent on conquest. Only the Domain of Soissons in Northern Gaul survived the conquests, forging alliances with the Franks to defend this Roman rump state from other invaders intent on conquering this rich land. \n\nBut now, Childeric of the Franks, the great ally of the Syagrii in Soissons, is dead. The new king, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] of the Franks, has no such alliance or friendship with the Romans and has declared an invasion of Soissons, claiming it for his own, a war that will decide the fate of Gaul and all of Western Europe forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313200;We will show those Romans who is powerful now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC313204;After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Burgundians maintained an alliance, if shaky, with the Franks to the north, with the two Germanic kingdoms supporting each other as they expanded at the expense of the Romans and Goths. However, as the Franks continued to grow and become more and more powerful, mercilessly conquering and destroying their neighbours, relations began to sour as the Franks became drawn into the various conflicts within the royal family. \n\nNow, after several raids and skirmishes between the two kingdoms, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has finally invaded with the intention of conquering the entire kingdom. Now, the Burgundians must make their stand or be destroyed and absorbed into the realms of the Franks, like so many before them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC313205;With the start of the Gothic War, Ostrogothic forces have been largely withdrawn from Provence for the defence of Italia, leaving the Praetorian Prefecture of Gaul to fend for itself. Seeking an opportunity, [Root.GetTitledName] has laid claim to the area declared war, seeking the riches of Provence for [Root.GetHerselfHimself].\n\nAs the prefect desperately gathers what militas and forces he can muster, an enormous Frankish host prepares to bear down on the largely undefended province.

Vowing to break the power of the Alemanni once and for all, [Root.GetTitledName] has raised a large army and launched an invasion of the Alemannic heartland.\n\nThe Alemanni were once among the fiercest and most tenacious enemies of Rome, but now face a threat of a completely different kind. It remains to see if the Alemanni will be able to successfully defend their treasured independence, or if the strength of the Franks is simply too much to bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME313271;Uniting the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313271;An emissary has arrived from [From.GetTitledName]. He heaps praise upon our prestige amongst the Frankish nation, poetically imploring us to share in his liege's greater vision. Whilst he speaks of the great things the Franks could do united, he also warns confidently of the great force that will be raised against us if we do not submit. Your hall falls deathly silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313271;The Franks will be stronger united.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313271;I will not bow to this upstart!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313272;Uniting the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313272;Your emmissary returns with a wagon of tribute, and a spring in his step. [From.GetTitledName] has acknowledged you as his new suzerain, and will serve your greater Frankish realm forthwith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313272;Excellent. He has made a wise choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313273;Uniting the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313273;Your emmisary has returned empty handed from [From.GetTitledName], his hair having been cut to the scalp and sporting one less ear than he had when he departed. [From.GetTitledName] has scorned your demand to join the greater Frankish realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313273;How dare [From.GetSheHe]?!? To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313273;We will deal with [From.GetHerHim] later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313274;Unification of the Franks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313274;In past times, the disunity of the Germanic tribes lining the Roman Empire has been their greatest weakness. Never before has the ambition of any one ruler been enough to challenge the might of Rome, but no longer. The Franks are now fully united, both Salian and Ripuarian, and the might of [Root.GetTitledName] is spoken of with fear all across western Europe. In Gaul the remnants of Rome and even the other Germanic kingdoms beyond regard [Root.GetTitledName] with trepidation, and rightly so. The rise of the Franks shows no signs of stopping. United under a common banner, the power of the Franks may well be enough to topple Roman rule once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313274;All of Gaul will tremble under my name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313274;May [Root.GetTitledName] bring glory to the Franks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313274;This is worrying news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313274;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313276;An Ultimatum Arrives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313276;An emissary has arrived from [From.GetTitledName] with a rather alarming demand. Accusing you and your court of all sorts of lecherous deeds and unforgivable slights against against [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetBestName] demands that we give up our kingdom and submit fully to [From.GetHerHis] rule, or face war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313276;I suppose we have no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313276;This is an outrage! Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313277;Demand Accepted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313277;Much to your surprise, [From.GetTitledName] has accepted the terms of your ultimatum, and has essentially delivered [From.GetHerHis] entire kingdom over to your control. The emissary offers many humble apologies on behalf of [From.GetFirstName], and entreats you to treat [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] family with mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313277;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313278;Demand Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313278;Your emissary has arrived rather worse for wear, the victim of [From.GetTitledName]'s rage at your accusations and demands. [From.GetTitledName] has cut off all ties and alliances, and it seems that there will not be a peaceful resolution to the problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313278;Well, this will be a quick war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313280;The Danish March;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313280;Fearing the growing power and the destructive raids of the Norse, [Root.GetTitledName] has declared the creation of the 'Danish March' on the lands between the Eider and the Schlei. The newly created march has been incorporated into the Kingdom of Saxony and will be heavily fortified and garrisoned, to serve as a first line of defence for the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] in the north.\n\n Already the Vikings are testing the march's defences, raiding its lands and attacking its castles. Time will tell if this fortified borderland will truly be able to protect the Danish border...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313280;The barbarians will not pass!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313280;Ha! This 'march' will not keep us out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME313290;The Merovingian Guard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313290;With the fall of the Merovingian dynasty, the traditional armed retinue of the Frankish kings has no rightful liege to serve. Their commander, [Root.GetFirstName], has decided to reform his ranks and convert the former royal guard into an independent mercenary company. They will be known as 'Frankish Fderati'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME314920;War in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314920;Thousands of Pictish warriors from the highland tribes of the north are gathering in the valleys of Scotia. They swore fealty to the [Root.GetTitledName], and in return they expect to be sent to conquer new lands for themselves south of Antonine's Wall.\n\nThe neighbouring kingdoms shall prepare to defend themselves from these fierce blue painted warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314920;We will conquer and rule those lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

########## IRISH AND GAELS ##########
EVTNAME314943;Gaelic Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314943;A large number of Gaelic warriors have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], hoping to take part in the plunder and glory in the conquests against the Picts. They are eager to fight under your banner, but should you stay put for too long they may soon grow restless and impatient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314943;Excellent! We will soon be ruling over Dunadd!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME314944;Gaelic Warriors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314944;Hearing of your recent successes against the Picts, another large number of Gaelic warriors have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], hoping to take part in the plunder and glory in your continued conquests. They are eager to fight under your banner, but should you stay put for too long they may soon grow restless and impatient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314944;Excellent! We will soon be ruling over Scotia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314945;The warriors gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName] in hopes of glory in riches have grown disillusioned by your continued refusal to go to war. They have returned to your homes and your reputation has suffered greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314945;At least they did not turn against us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314946;Following the conquest of [Root.GetName], many Gaelic warriors have settled in the province with their families. The local Picts are slowly adopting the culture of their conquerors, and [Root.GetName] is becoming more Gaelic day by day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314946;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
########## VISIGOTHS ##########
EVTNAME301200;The Fall of Aquitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301200;Crisis has struck our kingdom, as province after province falls to the Franks, even our former capital of Tolosa. However, though our armies have been driven out of Aquitania, the country is still thickly inhabited by Visigoths and pro-Gothic Roman nobles suspicious of their new Frankish overlords that maintain significant sympathy to our cause. However, this support will not last forever. We must strike a blow against the Franks and retake the southern provinces of Aquitania, or our adopted homeland will be forever lost to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301200;We will reconquer Aquitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP301200;We will gain a casus belli to reconquer the whole region of Southern Aquitania against anyone holding territory there. If we do not complete the conquest within 40 years, however, the dream of recovering Aquitania will fade away and we will lose access to this casus belli.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301201;Reconquest of Southern Aquitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301201;The armies of the Visigoths have made great strides, taking back the provinces of Novempopulania as well as the region around our former capital of Tolosa. Now is the time to strike the final blow against the Franks and reconquer all of Aquitania, our rightful territory stolen from us years earlier. However, though our earlier victories have bought us time and support, this support will not last forever. Should our offensives and momentum stall, our support will fade and the rest of our adopted homeland will be forever lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301201;We will reconquer Aquitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP301201;We will gain a casus belli to reconquer the remainder of Aquitania against anyone holding territory there. If we do not complete the conquest within 40 years, however, the dream of recovering Aquitania will fade away and we will lose access to this casus belli.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301209;Reconquest of Aquitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301209;The armies of the Franks have been shattered, and we have been able to bring all of Aquitania under our control once more. Visigothic rule now properly extends from Hispania to the Liger, as the proper Visigothic administration is restored to the people of Aquitania. As the barbarian Franks retreat the northern Gaul to lick their wounds, they have hopefully been taught an important lesson about challenging the iron strength of the Visigoths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301209;They will not return. Aquitania is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
########## OSTROGOTHS  ##########
EVTNAME302801;Rise of the Ostrogoths;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302801;[ostrogothic_king.GetTitledFirstName] of the Ostrogoths has emerged victorious in Italy following the murder of the former King Odoacer and his supporters in Ravenna during a banquet celebrating a peace treaty. All of Italy now lies firmly under the control of [ostrogothic_king.GetTitledFirstName], who has taken power as an ostensible viceroy of the Emperor and has promised to continue to respect the rights and administrations of his new Roman subjects.\n\nThe king has nonetheless expressed his desire to restore order and unity over the fractured West, pursuing marriage alliances with the various other Germanic kings. While the Ostrogoths seem content to rule over Italy for now, a sudden shift in the political environment - especially in Provence - could change that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302801;They are all barbarians anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Flush from his success in the conquest of the Vandal kingdom of Africa, [eastern_roman_emperor.GetTitledName] has directed his great general Belisarius to reconquer the provinces of Italy from the empire. Already Sicily and Dalmatia have fallen to the Roman armies, who are now marching through southern Italy towards Rome itself.\n\nOstrogothic armies have been withdrawn from Provence as they mount a desperate defence against the Romans, leaving the Praetorian Prefecture of Gaul to its fate. As Roman citizens defect to the empire and Ostrogothic nobles feud over the kingship abdicated by the former king [ostrogothic_king.GetFirstName], it seems that the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths is nearing its end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME302805;End of the Gothic War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302805;The Gothic War is over. The Gothic resurgence from 540 onwards nearly drove the Romans out of Italy while distracted in the East, but ultimately to no avail as the general Narses returned with a massive army. The last Ostrogothic king [ostrogothic_king.GetFirstName] was slain making his last stand near Mount Vesuvius, and with him the Kingdom of Ostrogoths ended, bringing to an end the 19 devastating years of war.\n\nWhile [eastern_roman_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] has proudly proclaimed the return of the mother city of Rome to the Empire, the cities of Italy lie devastated by the many years of war, and the overstretched Empire reels from the costs of his constant campaigns. It seems unlikely that there will be more campaigns to the west in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302805;The end of an era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME302811;The Ostrogothic Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC302811;War is brewing in the southeast of Gaul. [Root.GetTitledName] has declared war on [From.Holder.TopLiege.GetTitledName], claiming the need to restore order in the region in the wake of the fall of Visigothic Provence. A large Ostrogothic army has been spotted crossing the border into the province of [From.GetName], making its way to the city of Arelate.\n\nThe extent of [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s ambitions in Gaul remain to be seen, though many say [Root.GetSheHe] will not be content with simply a buffer zone in the south. The rulers of Gaul would be well advised to shore up their defences and watch this new player on the political scene closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA302811;Outrageous! Provence is [This.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] territory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC302813;The armies of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] have been defeated, and the Ostrogoths now stand triumphant over the lands of Provence. Wasting no time in reorganizing the area, [From.GetTitledName] has proclaimed the restoration of the defunct Praetorian Praefecture of Gaul and has appointed [Root.GetFullName] as the new prefect in [Root.Capital.GetName] to administer the newly conquered provinces.\n\nAs [From.GetTitledName] looks to secure his control over the newly conquered territory, rumours swirl in the courts of Gaul about [From.GetHerHis] next move. All eyes are now carefully watching the Ostrogoths, waiting to see if they will return to Italy in triumph or if they harbour further ambitions in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Visigoths have rebuffed a final Ostrogothic ultimatum to appoint [Root.GetTitledName] regent, and war has broken out in the south of Gaul once more. \n\nSpeaking of the need to 'restore order' to the 'chaotic and unstable' Visigothic realm, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has ordered the great Ostrogothic host in Arelate to march on the remaining Visigothic territories and forcibly subjugate the Visigoths to [Root.GetHerHis] rule.
