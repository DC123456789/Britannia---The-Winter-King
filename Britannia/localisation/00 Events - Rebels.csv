EVTDESCbetter_rebels.1;A violent revolt has broken out in [From.GetName].\nAngered by the oppressive rule of [From.County.Holder.GetTitledName], the local commoners have taken to arms. Unfortunately, their indiscriminate destruction will affect our holdings as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### LOCAL RESISTANCE EVENTS ###
EVTDESC320701;The people of [From.GetName] resent what they see as our foreign rule over the province. Hostility has sprung up against our garrisons and administrators, and the rugged terrain means that it is difficult to properly exert our authority. Even with our best efforts we should not expect resistance to our rule to go away quietly anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320701;Ungrateful scum...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320701TT;§RRemote Provinces§! deep in the mountains or hidden behind dense forests are difficult to properly control and tend to be quite hostile to foreign lords trying to enforce their rule over the region. These provinces are restless and difficult to control - even a minor disturbance or rebellion can rapidly escalate into a dangerous §RMajor Revolt§! spreading across the entire region, if not quickly brought under control. Remote Province modifiers can be decreased and eventually removed by taking the §YPacification§! title decision, and can also be handled in the short term by granting the provinces to vassals of the §Ylocal culture§! or establishing §YMarcher Lords§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB320701;Stop bothering me about this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320722_defender;The revolt in [revolt_target.GetName] is gaining momentum.

EVTDESC320722_potential_rebel;The revolt in [revolt_target.GetName] is gaining momentum. Never fully pacified, the neighbouring provinces are quickly growing agitated at this apparent sign of weakness, and our suzerain's tenuous control over the region is threatening to falter. If this rebellion is not contained soon, this could be an excellent opportunity to throw off the [current_suzerain.Culture.GetName] yoke...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320722;Rally our forces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320722TTA;If the revolt reaches a warscore of §Y50%§!, a §RMajor Revolt§! will break out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
