### LOCAL RESISTANCE EVENTS ###
EVTDESC320701;The people of [From.GetName] resent what they see as our foreign rule over the province. Hostility has sprung up against our garrisons and administrators, and the rugged terrain means that it is difficult to properly exert our authority. Even with our best efforts we should not expect resistance to our rule to go away quietly anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320701;Ungrateful scum...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320701TT;§RRemote Provinces§! deep in the mountains or nestled behind dense forests are difficult to properly control and tend to be quite hostile to foreign lords trying to enforce their rule over the region. These provinces are restless and difficult to control - even a minor disturbance or rebellion can rapidly escalate into a dangerous §RMajor Revolt§! spreading across the entire region, if not quickly brought under control. Remote Province modifiers can be decreased and eventually removed by taking the §YPacification§! title decision, and can also be handled in the short term by granting the provinces to vassals of the §Ylocal culture§! or establishing §YMarcher Lords§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB320701;Stop bothering me about this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB320701TT;You will no longer receive notifications about Remote Provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320711;Our pacification program in [pacified_province.GetName] has come to fruition. Loyal forts watch over strategic sites and supply routes, and we have managed to come to an understanding with some of the local elites. While many locals may still be resentful of our presence, our hold over the province seems secure, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320711;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320711TT;All §RRemote Province§! modifiers have been removed from [pacified_province.GetName], and the province will no longer participate in §RMajor Revolts§!. However, Pacification may be lost if the province is reconquered by a native realm for long enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB320711;I do not need to know every small detail...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320722_defender;The revolt in [revolt_target.GetName] is gaining momentum. Never fully pacified, the neighbouring provinces are quickly growing agitated at this apparent sign of weakness, and our tenuous control over the region is threatening to falter.

EVTDESC320722_defender_vassal_or_march;The revolt in [revolt_target.GetName] is gaining momentum.

If this rebellion is not contained soon, this could be an excellent opportunity to throw off the [current_suzerain.Culture.GetName] yoke...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320722;Rally our forces!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320722TT;If the revolt reaches a warscore of §Y50%§! or wins, a §RMajor Revolt§! will break out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As rebels rise up across the region seeking to throw off the [main_revolt_defender.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] yoke, the besieged defenders must rally their forces and act quickly or risk losing control over the region altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB320727TT;Refrain from joining the §YMajor Revolt§! in §Y[current_resistance_region_province.GetLocalResistanceRegion]§!. We can still join in later if we attempt to declare independence while the revolt is still ongoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320728_spread;The great revolt in [current_resistance_region_province.GetLocalResistanceRegion] is spreading! The small local revolt in [revolt_target.GetName] has exploded into a fully fledged uprising at the inability of [main_revolt_defender.GetTitledName] to quickly suppress it, as the ongoing chaos elsewhere encouraged the discontented populace to rise up at this apparent sign of weakness. We are now seeing a wave of support as men rally to the flag of our already ongoing rebellion, and with our enemies now quite distracted it will not be long before we successfully throw off throw off the [main_revolt_defender.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] yoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320728TT1;An army of warriors has gathered in the capital to join our rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320745;It appears that our recent successes have led many of our fellow rebels to regard us as a sort of unofficial leader of the revolt.
