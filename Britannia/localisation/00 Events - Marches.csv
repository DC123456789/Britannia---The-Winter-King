EVTNAME320935;An Independent [Root.GetHeldMarchTitleName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320935;While we have declared our independence, our old overlord naturally still refuses to see us as anything more than a wayward vassal and is even now scheming to bring us back under their fold. While the size and prestige of our march means that we should be will able to fight off any such attempts, it will be some time before our independence is grudgingly accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA320935TT;Our old overlord and possibly other neighbouring kingdoms will be able to use the §YRestore March§! casus belli to force us to recognize their suzerainty again. If we can resist their attempts for §Y35§! years, other kings will have no choice but to recognize our independence, and will be able to take on the full trappings of an independent kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
