EVTNAME320900;[k_breton_march.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320900;Seeking to protect [FromFrom.GetHerHis] lands from Armorican raids and uprisings, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has proclaimed the creation of the [k_breton_march.GetFullBaseName] on the western borders of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] realm. With special privileges and a high level of autonomy, this newly created march has been entrusted to the rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and has been given control over all the [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective]-held provinces in Armorica as well as some of the neighboring counties.\n\nThe newly appointed margrave faces a difficult task, as the rebellious peoples of Armorica will be eager to pounce on any signs of weakness. It remains to be seen if this new march will be successful at pacifying the fiercely independent Armoricans, or collapse under the weight of wars and political intrigue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME320901;[k_vasconia.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320901;Seeking to protect [FromFrom.GetHerHis] lands from persistent and growing Vasconian raids, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has proclaimed the creation of the [k_vasconia.GetFullBaseName] on the southern borders of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] realm. With special privileges and a high level of autonomy, this newly created duchy has been entrusted to the rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and has been given control over all the [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective]-held provinces in the area, from the forests of Aquitania Tertia all the way to the Garumna river.\n\nThe newly appointed duke will soon face the difficult task of defending the region and subduing the rebellious Vasconian tribes. It remains to be seen how successful the new duchy will be at defending the southern frontier - and, if so, how willing these powerful dukes are to submit to royal power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320902;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] has proclaimed the creation of the [k_wales.GetFullBaseName] on the western borders of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] realm, aiming to cement [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] control over the rebellious Welsh provinces. With special privileges and a high level of autonomy, this newly created earldom has been entrusted to the rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and has been granted almost complete authority over all of the [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective]-held provinces in Wales.\n\nThe newly appointed earl will soon face the difficult task of defending [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] interests and in the area and keeping the Britons subjugated. Faced with the harsh terrain of the Cambrian Mountains and the difficulty of routing the Welsh from their mountain redoubts, it remains to be seen how successful the new march will be at maintaining [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] authority in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320903;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] has proclaimed the creation of the [k_pictland.GetFullBaseName] on the northern borders of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] realm, aiming to improve [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] defenses in the region and better control the unruly Pictish tribes. With special privileges and a high level of autonomy, this newly created earldom has been entrusted to the rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstName] and has been given control over all [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective]-held lands on the frontier.\n\nThe newly appointed earl faces a difficult task in defending [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] authority in the remote and mountainous region, with the rebellious Picts ready to rise at any signs of weakness. It remains to be seen if the new march will be finally successful at pacifying the highlands, or if any attempts to impose foreign authority in the region are simply doomed to failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320904;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] has proclaimed the creation of the [k_romancaledonia.GetBaseName] on the northern frontier of the empire, aiming to better control the unruly Pictish tribes and fortify the restive region. Many special privileges have been granted to the newly created province, which has been entrusted to the rule of Governor [Root.GetDynName] with control over all [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective]-held lands on the Caledonian frontier.\n\nThe newly appointed governor faces a difficult task in defending [FromFrom.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] authority in the remote and mountainous region, with the rebellious Caledonian tribes ready to rise at any signs of weakness. It remains to be seen if this is what will finally bring the northernmost provinces of Britannia under Roman rule, or if a Roman Caledonia is simply not meant to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME320910;[k_wales.GetFullBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320910;Following the successful pacification of the Welsh frontier, [Root.GetTitledName] has decreed the revocation of the special privileges and high level of autonomy originally granted to the Welsh March to help defend and fortify the region, officially reverting the march into an ordinary Earldom and effectively annexing the [e_aengland.GetAdjective] provinces in Wales into the realm.\n\nWhile no longer able to act as a near-independent ruler, the former marcher lord - now Earl of Wales - remains a powerful lord suzerain over the former provinces of the march, and it remains to be seen if the integration of such a powerful vassal will upset the balance of power inside the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320921_march;The [kingdom_to_de_jure_drift_to.GetFullBaseName], on behalf of the [march_suzerain_title.GetHolderPeopleName] rulers of [kingdom_to_de_jure_drift_to.GetTitleGeneralRegion], has conquered the [duchy_to_de_jure_drift.GetFullName] and taken full possession of the area.\n\nFrom this day on, [duchy_to_de_jure_drift.GetTitleProvincesDescription] will be considered an integral and 'de jure' part of the [kingdom_to_de_jure_drift_to.GetFullBaseName]. Any previous claim or birthright will no longer be recognized, and the new [march_suzerain_title.GetHolderPeopleName] rulers will be considered the only rightful lieges of these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320923;The lands that formed the [duchy_to_de_jure_drift.GetFullName] have been reconquered from the foreign lords of the [kingdom_to_de_jure_drift_out_of.GetFullBaseName] that once dared to claim the region for themselves.\n\nFrom this day on, [duchy_to_de_jure_drift.GetTitleProvincesDescription] will once again belong 'de jure' to the [kingdom_to_de_jure_drift_out_of.GetFullName]. Any previous claim or birthright from the former rulers will no longer be recognized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320926;I have decided to entrust you with protecting the lands of [FromFromFrom.GetFullName] as part of your march in recognition of your service and your nobility of spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320930;We have decided to immediately revoke the [Root.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName] as well as all associated march privileges. Failure to hand it over peacefully will lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320931;I humbly accept your decision to revoke the [From.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName], though it grieves me deeply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320932;I will not allow you to steal my titles and privileges without a fight! You are no longer my liege lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME320935;An Independent [Root.GetHeldMarchTitleName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320935;While we have declared our independence, our old overlord naturally still refuses to see us as anything more than a wayward vassal and is even now scheming to bring us back under their fold. While the size and prestige of our march means that we should be will able to fight off any such attempts, it will be some time before our independence is grudgingly accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320935;Our forts will be waiting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320935TT;Our old overlord and possibly other neighbouring kingdoms will be able to use the §YRestore March§! casus belli to force us to recognize their suzerainty again. If we can resist their attempts for §Y35§! years, other kings will have no choice but to recognize our independence, and will be able to take on the full trappings of an independent kingdom.\n§RAll march-related modifiers and mechanics will be disabled as long as we are independent.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME320936;March Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320936;The treacherous [From.GetTitledName] has used the extensive power and privileges we granted [From.GetHerHim] to rebel against us and end any pretence of suzerainty. As the ruler of a large and powerful march [From.GetSheHe] surely aspires to be recognized as a sovereign ruler in [From.GetHerHis] own right - something we must surely prevent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320936;We will soon teach them a lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320936TT;The §YRestore March§! casus belli can be used to force [From.GetTitledName] to return to your suzerainty as a march. If, however, the [Root.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName] manages to stay independent for §Y35§! years, we will be forced to give up our claims over the area and recognize it as an independent kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME320937;The [Root.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320937;It has been many years since the [Root.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName] obeyed the decrees of its old overlord, and since we gained our effective independence even the pretence of suzerainty has been slowly slipping away. It is time that we be properly recognized as not just an errant vassal, but an independent realm in our own right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320937;Perhaps a crown of our own is in order...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320937TT;The §Y[Root.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName]§! will now be recognized as a proper kingdom and can now be created and destroyed like any other title.\nThe §YRestore March§! casus belli can no longer be used against us, and march mechanics will be permanently disabled for the §Y[Root.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName]§! unless the title is destroyed and a new march created.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
