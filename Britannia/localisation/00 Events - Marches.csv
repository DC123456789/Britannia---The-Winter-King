EVTNAME320923;[duchy_to_de_jure_drift.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320923;The lands that formed the [duchy_to_de_jure_drift.GetFullName] have been reconquered from the foreign lords of the [kingdom_to_de_jure_drift_out_of.GetFullBaseName] that once dared to claim the region for themselves.\n\nFrom this day on, [duchy_to_de_jure_drift.GetTitleProvincesDescription] will once again belong 'de jure' to the [kingdom_to_de_jure_drift_out_of.GetFullName]. Any previous claim or birthright from the former rulers will no longer be recognized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320923;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320925;I have decided to entrust you with protecting the [From.GetFullName] as part of your march in recognition of your service and your nobility of spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320926;I have decided to entrust you with protecting the lands of [From.GetFullName] as part of your march in recognition of your service and your nobility of spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320926;I have decided to entrust you with protecting the lands of [FromFromFrom.GetFullName] as part of your march in recognition of your service and your nobility of spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320930;We have decided to immediately revoke the [Root.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName] as well as all associated march privileges. Failure to hand it over peacefully will lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320931;I humbly accept your decision to revoke the [From.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName], though it grieves me deeply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320932;I will not allow you to steal my titles and privileges without a fight! You are no longer my liege lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME320935;An Independent [Root.GetHeldMarchTitleName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320935;While we have declared our independence, our old overlord naturally still refuses to see us as anything more than a wayward vassal and is even now scheming to bring us back under their fold. While the size and prestige of our march means that we should be will able to fight off any such attempts, it will be some time before our independence is grudgingly accepted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320935;Our forts will be waiting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320935TT;Our old overlord and possibly other neighbouring kingdoms will be able to use the §YRestore March§! casus belli to force us to recognize their suzerainty again. If we can resist their attempts for §Y35§! years, other kings will have no choice but to recognize our independence, and will be able to take on the full trappings of an independent kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME320936;March Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC320936;The treacherous [From.GetTitledName] has used the extensive power and privileges we granted [From.GetHerHim] to rebel against us and end any pretence of suzerainty. As the ruler of a large and powerful march [From.GetSheHe] surely aspires to be recognized as a sovereign ruler in [From.GetHerHis] own right - something we must surely prevent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320936;We will soon teach them a lesson.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320936TT;The §YRestore March§! casus belli can be used to force [From.GetTitledName] to return to your suzerainty as a march. If, however, the [Root.GetHeldMarchTitleFullName] manages to stay independent for §Y35§! years, we will be forced to give up our claims over the area and recognize it as an independent kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
