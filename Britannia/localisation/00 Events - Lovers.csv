EVTDESC_WOL_1172;When having too many lovers, it gets hard to spend enough time with all of them to keep the love vivid. Today, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has come to me and declared that I should spend more time with [From.GetHerHim], or else [From.GetSheHe]'ll break up with me for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_1172_INC;Constantly being bedridden and being unable to move or even speak at times does no good for my relationships. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has stated that [From.GetSheHe] has had enough of not being able to do anything with me, and that [From.GetSheHe] no longer feels the love we once had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WOL_1172_PRI;Locked up in a damp and cold room, I can see one of my most cruel guards come to me. He holds a letter in his hand. 'It is from [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].' He says, 'As it turns out, [From.GetSheHe] no longer wants to be with someone so far away from [From.GetHerHim].' He throws the letter in my face, laughs at me and walks off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_WOL_1172;It's fine, I have more lovers. I can miss you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_WOL_1172;Of course I can spend more time with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
