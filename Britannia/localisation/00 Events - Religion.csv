############### DRUIDIC THEOLOGY FOCUS/AMBITION CHAIN ###############
EVTDESC312620;Your newfound interest in the cults and practices of the druids has caught the interest of your Seer, [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledName]. [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHeCap] has offered to help train you to gain the skills knowledge to join the ranks of the druids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312620;Tell me more of the secrets of the druids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312620;No, I have no time to focus on such things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312621;One of the most important tasks of a druid is to perform human sacrifices to divine the future. You watch as your Seer, [Root.job_spiritual.GetTitledName], calmly stabs a prisoner in the stomach and begins to watch the wretched prisoner's movements. You note every spasm as [Root.job_spiritual.GetSheHe] explains how to interpret the augury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312621;So... that was a good omen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312622;Charms are powerful things, and a druid that can create and use them effectively is a powerful one indeed. Today, your Seer has been talking about charms - charms to give you good luck, charms to cure the sick, charms to protect yourself, charms to curse your enemies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312622;I hope nobody has a piece of my hair...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312623;Druidism is an unwritten tradition, but that just means that each Druid has the vast lore of the art memorized. You have been spending much time in secluded caves and forests with your Seer, learning the ancient lore of the druids, including vast histories and secrets stretching back centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312623;So many verses... but I will memorize them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312624;While not quite as powerful or respected as druids, the bards occupy an important role in Celtic society, composing and singing songs and poems about the kings and events of today and those long past. Highly learned and acclaimed, their beautiful songs and long traditions give them a central role in society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312624;I will take up the traditions of the bards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312624;No, I will continue to pursue the path of the druids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312625;A druid is not merely a religious leader, but one with great influence among society at large. It is important for a druid to be able to speak and communicate well in order to establish his power, and you and your Seer have spent much time practising speeches and proclamations that a druid would often do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312625;Soon all will hear and respect my words!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312626;While not the primary role of the druids, it is expected that anybody wise enough to be a druid would have at least basic administrative skills. Recognizing your deficiencies in this area, you have been working hard to improve your stewardship and your ability to effectively manage your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312626;Well, working with books isn't quite as much of a chore anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312627;Though primarily a religious position, it is important for a druid to be well-versed in the deep intrigues of power and politics. As your Seer tells you stories of plots and intrigues of druids and gods in a time long past, you listen closely, trying to learn some of the more interesting secrets of the ancient wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312627;Druids are quite a conniving people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312628;Studying the druidic arts has given you a new outlook on the faith that you was looked upon with mistrust, and you are no longer quite as cynical as you once were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312628;The Gods are indeed among us. Probably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312629;As you study your faith more and more, you have become increasingly drawn into its exclusive outlook, and are becoming more and more critical of other faiths and practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312629;No longer will I see infidels in the same light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312630;Since beginning your studies of druidism, your faith has only risen and grown. Now, having studied its most important tenements and secrets, never before have you been more certain of the superiority of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312630;For [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312631;Your studies of the cults and practices of the druids has given you newfound confidence and a sense of power, reducing your formerly all-consuming fear of things unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312631;No one will call me craven now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312632;Studying the cults of the druids is quite hard work. No longer can you afford to be lazy and let others do the work for you, but now you must actually work hard in order to achieve success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312632;It is work that must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312633;As your studies continue, you are no longer content to simply let things happen. You have begun to stop accepting your situation for what it is and are beginning to work to change it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312633;I will try a little harder, but it's not that important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312634;As you continue your studies of the druidic arts, your drive to succeed has risen. If you are to excel, you must drive yourself much more to your goals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312634;I will become the greatest druid of them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
############### BRYTHONIC PAGANISM ###############
EVTNAME316000;Failed Reformation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316000;Despite our great power and piety, the druids insist that the people of Britannia are not ready for such a radical change in their religion. Only once the 13 Treasures of Britain are gathered once more and the Old Gods Restored in the ancient ritual will the ancient faith of the Britons be ready for such a reformation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME316002;The Brythonic Archdruidship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC316010;As the first Archdruid of the Brythonic faith, it is your duty to ensure that the new Brythonic hierachy continues after your death.

EVTNAME316012;Invitation for Candidacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316012;As a druid, you are one of the most highly respected religious figures in the Brythonic world. As such, the Circle of Druids has invited you to be considered to be the next successor to the Archdruidship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA316012;I would be interested in this opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB316012;No, I do not think that I would make the best candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC316012TT;You offer your name as a candidate. You will be judged based on several factors, including your piety, prestige, learning, diplomacy, rank, and traits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME3160121;No Potential Candidates;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3160121;It has come to your attention that despite your best efforts to search far and wide, your council has been unable to find any landed druids worthy of your esteemed position. Without a proper successor to succeed you, the Briton Archdruidship will become vacant after your death unless a suitable candidate presents himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3160121;This is quite worrying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME3160170;Successor Chosen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3160170;After a long discussion regarding the abilities and worthiness of each druid that had offered himself as a candidate, you and the Circle of Druids have settled on [briton_druid_successor.GetTitledName] as a suitable successor for the Archdruidship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME316020;A New Successor Candidate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316020;With the lack of a recognized successor to the Brythonic Archdruidship, [From.GetTitledName] has presented [From.GetHerselfHimself] as a druid worthy of the position. While perhaps not the perfect candidate, [From.GetSheHe] is certainly fit to fill the much-needed position to ensure the line of Archdruids continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA316020;Excellent! [From.GetSheHe] would be a worthy successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB316020;No, I do not think he would make a suitable archdruid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME316021;Petition Accepted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316021;After some consideration, [From.GetTitledName] has agreed that you are fit to succeed [From.GetHerHim] as the Brythonic Archdruid, and has publicly declared you his successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA316021;Excellent! Praise [This.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME316022;Petition Denied;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316022;After some consideration, [From.GetTitledName] has decided that you are not fit to succeed [From.GetHerHim] as the Brythonic Archdruid, and has refused your request to make you [From.GetHerHis] successor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME316023;Successor Chosen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316023;After a lapse in which there was no suitable druid to succeed [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetTitledName] and the Circle of Druids have settled on [briton_druid_successor.GetTitledName] as a suitable successor for the Archdruidship, avoiding a possible interregnum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME316025;No Candidates;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316025;Despite having sent out invitations to several prominent druids inviting them to be your successor, no one has expressed any interest in that position. It seems that you will have to go and ask one of them to be your successor yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA316025;I have just the person in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME316026;Request to be Successor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316026;It seems that nobody has offered himself up as a candidate to succeed [From.GetTitledName], as [From.GetSheHe] has come asking you personally to fill the position. Despite you having earlier rejected the idea of becoming the next Archdruid, [From.GetTitledName] believes that you would make a suitable successor to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA316026;Very well then. If no one else will, I will succeed you as Archdruid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME316028;Reclaiming the Archdruidship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316028;Following the death of the previous Archdruid, the Brythonic Archdruidship had been vacant as there was no suitable successor ready to fill the position.

EVTNAME316303;Loss of the Pontificate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316303;Without an imperial title to your name, you are no longer enough of a respected authority to hold on to your position as head of the Roman faith. Without any Roman emperor powerful enough to control it, the title of the Pontifex Maximus has been surrendered and rendered vacant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA316303;This is unacceptable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME316304;Destruction of the Pontificate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC316304;Without an imperial title to his name, From.GetTitledName] is no longer enough of a respected authority to hold on to your position as head of the Roman faith. Without any Roman emperor powerful enough to control it, the title of the Pontifex Maximus has been surrendered and rendered vacant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA316304;Who will lead the College of Pontiffs now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
############### MANICHAEISM ###############
EVTDESC301703;As an adult, you can now officially join the body of the Hearers, the lay followers of the Manichaean faith. While of lower standing than the Elect, as a Hearer you will not be bound be the vows of Manichaeism and you will be free to do the important work that runs the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301703_1;You have now reached adulthood, and now you must face an important choice in your spiritual future. As the child of an esteemed Elect family, you are expected to follow in the footsteps of your forefathers, but taking the vows of the Elect requires following the strict lifestyle dictated by Mani. The life of a Hearer is much more liberating, but at a cost to your religious standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301703;I will take the vows and become a true believer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301703;That puritanical cult is not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC301703;The Elect will show us the way forwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301710;Your piety and virtues have not gone unnoticed by the religious community. Your local presbyster has approached you and told you that he believes you have what it takes to join the ranks of the Elect. Will you take the vows of Manichaenism, putting away your earthly life to live as the prophet Mani proclaimed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301710;I will dedicate my life to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301710;No, the vows are not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301711;The life of an Elect requires strict adherence to Mani's laws, and an austere life of fasting, singing, and praying. You have proven unable to follow the vows of Manichaeism, and your local religious leadership has decided eject you from the body of the Elect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301711;I never liked that priggish cult anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301720;Manicheanism Restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301720;Manicheanism, the centuries old Gnostic faith from Eranshahr, had until recently been on a deep, seemingly inescapable decline set in motion by the old Roman Empire. The followers of Mani had been all but extinguished from the west, and it had seemed as though the light would finally go out, but thanks to the efforts of a reinvigorated Roman successor state, Manicheanism has also seen a miraculous resurgence, thanks in part to the patronage of the Roman successor state. With this newfound strength, Manicheanism stands to bring the light to the darkest corners of the world...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301720;The Light fears no Darkness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301720;We shall see what becomes of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC301725;After the series of sweeping reforms and laws establishing Manicheanism as the de-facto religion of the Roman successor state, a large group of former soldiers and young men have come together to form the Order of the Purifying Light. These zealous men have sworn to defend all Manicheans from the Darkness with their lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME301725;Purifying Light;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA301725;A Surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB301725;Madmen, the lot of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
