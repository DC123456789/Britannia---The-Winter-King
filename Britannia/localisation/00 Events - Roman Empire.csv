EVTNAME312120;Death of Julius Nepos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312120;Julius Nepos, the current de jure Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, has been murdered by members of his own military in Dalmatia. Some say the murder was ordered by Odoacer, head of the Germanic Foederati in Italy and de facto ruler of the Italian peninsula since 476 AD.\n\nWith the death of Julius Nepos, the last serious legal claim to the Western Roman Empire belongs now to the ruling Syagrii dynasty of Soissons.\n\nBefore aspiring to reclaim the imperial title, however, the Roman rulers in northern Gaul will have to deal with the increasingly hostile warbands of the Franks, seeking to expand their control to the west.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME315900;Fall of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC315900;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] is no more.

EVTOPTB315901;Very well then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC315906;The strict seperation of civil and military authorities in the Roman Imperial system means that legionary commanders cannot control any land. The vassal you have just transferred to [From.GetTitledName] will be returned to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME315935;The Donativum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC315935;The Roman army is strong but fickle, with gold being the primary and often the only reliable way of securing their loyalty. Traditionally, a new emperor would seek to support of the army by paying out a large donativum to his soldiers upon his ascension, particularly to the praetorians and legionaries, and now your commanders are waiting expectantly for the treasury to be opened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA315935;The loyalty of the army is priceless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
