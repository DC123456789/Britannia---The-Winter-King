EVTDESC_EDM_1;While walking through a forest near my capital, I noticed a very strange powder under a tree. Upon further inspection I couldn't recognise what it was, so I decided to take it to my laboratory and run some experiments.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_1;I must know what this is.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_2;After a long walk back to my laboratory, safely keeping the powder in a bag, and preparing all my experiments, it's time to begin. For the first experiment, I'll be burning some of it.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_2;I hope nothing goes wrong.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_3;I put a little bit of the powder into a small stone tub, and heated a few blocks of wood. While the powder got hotter, it started glowing bright red, and a few grains started burning. The burning pattern wasn't special, but it doesn't seem to be of known material, which is good news.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_3;To the next experiment, mixing with water.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_4;The exact moment the powder started to heat, I was already able to recognise that it had nothing special, even worse, it seems that my powder was nothing but a weirdly coloured type of wood. How could I have missed that.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_4;This was useless...;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_TLT_EDM_4;The powder is discarded.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_5;I got everything ready for my experiment. I put a few grains of the powder on some glowing hot wood. In the beginning, it seems that the powder seems mostly heat-resistant. But soon it starts glowing a combination of blue and yellow, and before I get the chance to take notes, the powder suddenly explodes, hitting me.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_5;I need to continue anyway!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_5;This is far too dangerous.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_6;The next experiment is mixing the powder with normal spring water. I filtered the water with a cloth to make sure it is clean, and now it's time for the experiment to commence.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_6;Will it mix or not?;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_7;I got a tub with my clean water ready for the experiment and I sprinkle some of the powder on the water surface. At first nothing happens, and when I use a stick to mix the water and the powder, it simply mixes. After a few minutes the powder starts floating and separating from the water again.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_7;Seems quite... uninteresting.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_8;I scoop up some of the powder from its bag and submerge it in the water. The powder instantly starts reacting, dissolving in mere seconds. A large amount of gas is released and soon enough the water is back to its original state, clean and throughvisible. ;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_8;A most interesting reaction.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_9;I sprinkle some powder into a test tube filled with clean water, and get very disappointing results. The powder sinks like a stone in a pond, and how hard I try to mix it with the water by stirring and shaking, nothing happens at all.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_9;Seems quite... uninteresting.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_10;I sprinkle some of the strange powder into a tub filled with water. For a short while, the powder is on the bottom of the tub, with nothing happening. I am about to cancel the experiment when the powder suddenly starts to violently dissolve into a green gas, soon filling the entire laboratory. It didn't take long before I started to feel unwell and I stormed out of my laboratory.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_11;The next experiment is maybe a bit cruel, but for our collective knowledge I am willing to do this. I ordered my courtiers to find and catch a healthy rabbit. A few hours after they dispatched, they return with a rabbit in a cage. I am going to test my powder's toxicity on this rabbit.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_11;Sorry, dear rabbit...;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_11;This was your destiny this whole time.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_12;Okay, just a non-dangerous powder.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_14;I'm sorry, dear rabbit.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_14;Sucks to be you *sniggers*.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_15;This is oddly funny.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_15;I fed the poor rabbit some of the powder, at first it was hesitant, but after hiding some of it in some lettuce, the rabbit starts eating. It doesn't take long for the rabbit to act weird. The animal starts jumping around like crazy and tirelessly running through the town around my laboratory. It takes a long time before me and my courtiers manage to catch it again.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_14;The rabbit seems to like the smell of this powder, and starts eating it like it's a dessert. But soon it turns into his final meal. The poor rabbit, once happily jumping around, is now laying motionless on the floor of my laboratory, dead. The powder is clearly poisonous.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_13;My courtiers firmly had to hold the rabbit, who tried to escape back to freedom. I tried putting some powder in its mouth, but got bit. When trying the second time, however, I am successful. The rabbit did manage to escape from my courtiers, but was found a few hundred meters further, in a field, ill. The poor animal did recover, but the toxicity of the powder was confirmed.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_12;The rabbit didn't hesitate before eating the powder, and running off, but I managed to catch it and cage the rabbit before it could exit the laboratory. A day passes by while I am closely watching the rabbit. The rabbit doesn't get ill or anything and the following I had it released back to the wilderness again.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_16;Now I've done all my experiments, it's time to write down my findings and publish them. I got my adept ready, and together we are going to work on maybe the greatest paperwork this decade.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_16;Maybe I'll be remembered for centuries to come.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_17;My papers are finished! Me and my ever loyal adepts have worked for over a month, writing, verifying and reading through my texts. It is clearly time to publish my great finds in the societal library.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_17;Knowledge rules!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_18;While I, together my loyal courtiers, I am looking through an old Roman fort, hidden inside a beautifully decorated one-eared amphora I find a very weird powder. I spend a minute observing it and came to the conclusion I didn't know this powder yet. I put some in a bag and went to my laboratory to run some experiments;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_19;My courtiers firmly had to hold the rabbit, who tried to escape back to freedom. I tried putting some powder in its mouth, but got bit. When trying the second time, however, I am successful. The rabbit escaped, but was found a few hundred meters further, in an abandoned Roman sewage system, ill. The poor animal did recover, but the toxicity of the powder was confirmed.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_20;I am called to the gates of my capital by my courtiers because a Roman centurion arrived at my realm today. He says that he was called back to Rome to defend the empire, but unfortunately got lost in unknown terrain. He requests that I can help him get back home, or that he can stay at my court.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_20;Help him get back to Rome.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_20;Welcome him to my court.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EDM_20;Someone else's got to help him.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_EDM_20;Kill this unwanted guest.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_21;While out hunting with my men, our hunting party stumbles upon a set of shining things half buried in the ground. When we approach it we quickly come to realise it are Roman Aquilae, great Roman eagle standards carried by Roman soldiers and for them a source of bravery and pride. I could send them back to the emperor, which he'll greatly approve of, or keep them.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_21;Send them back to the emperor.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_21;Keep them myself.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_22;It really surprised me and my courtiers when we found a couple of Aquilae, that had somehow gone unnoticed for decades after the empire fell, in an old Roman holding. These eagle standards were of great importance to our ancestors, but they could also be worth a lot of money when molten and minted into coins.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_22;Melt them and make some profit.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_22;I shall keep our heritage safe.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_23;My hunting party and I are chasing a deer, when one of my friends notices something of much greater worth. I never expected that even after the empire fell, we would still find evidence of the vile oppression by the Romans long ago. Near a small stream my men found a shining Aquila, a respected eagle standard for the Romans that suppressed our peoples for years.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_23;Destroy these vile signs of oppression!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_23;I got a merchant and I do need some money...;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_24;A merchant comes to me at a market, saying that he has travelled the entire realm to find the best horse he could. He claims to have found it, and now he wants to sell it to me for a reasonable price.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_24;This is surely a good deal.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_24;No, I hate horses!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_25;A bewildered man has been very prominent in my capital lately as he speaks of the strangest of things. He claims to see faces of women in endless fog banks. However crazy it might seem, the peasants seem to believe it, which causes quite the unrest.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_25;He must be stopped.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_25;Maybe he does have a point.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EDM_25;I can see faces in fog too.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_EDM_25_TT1;The unrest stops soon after the man is arrested.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_EDM_25_TT2;The peasants get more upset by the arrest.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_26;I was approached by some of my courtiers who demand clarification of some of the scandals surrounding me lately. I try telling them the same lie I've told many times before, but one of my courtiers steps forward to me and says: 'Do you really think that lie will work forever?'.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_26;Yes, it does. And for you it would too.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_27;For a traditional feast next week it is prescribed for rulers to gather a lot of wood, to burn it on giant bonfires. This year my courtiers have organised a small championship: whoever gathers the most wood will be the winner.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_27;I will become the champion.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_27;I'll just use some spare wood of my courtiers.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_28;Today a foreign trading party has come to my court, and they want to sell me their wares from around the known world. They are asking for quite a high amount of wealth for it, so my courtiers and I wonder if it really is a good idea.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_28;I'll take the risk.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_EDM_28_TT1;You take a look through all the wares.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_28;I refuse to do this.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_29;After looking through all the wares, I realise that almost all the wares are just next to useless. The best I can do is sell them to partially make up for the loss.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_29;That's a risk of trading.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_30;I look through the wares, and even though most of it is worthless, some things seem to be worth a lot, so I resell them to other merchants for quite some profit.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_30;Great!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_32;The wares that the merchants brought me are beautiful, and it would definitely increase my standing among other lords if I would decorate my courtroom with these wares. Some other wares can simply be sold for a little bit of profit.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_33;I had recently tried to work on my diplomatic skills, but because of a sudden outburst of anger towards the person I tried to have a normal talk with to train my diplomacy, the people around me are a bit upset.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_EDM_33;I tried, and failed miserably.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_34;How good being honest might be, some people will simply never understand. But that 'some people' quickly changed to 'most people' in a few days. From calling someone's wife fat to telling my cook that the food tasted like poison, my behaviour gets on everyone's nerves.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_34;They should just be able to handle the truth.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_34;This world just doesn't allow virtue.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_EDM_34;Maybe I should change.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_35;I had a local landowner arrive at my court today. In a recent disaster a large part of his family died, including all his children and wife. Now, with no secure inheritance for his family, he has sold off his land and seeks to join my court.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_35;Of course you can!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_35;Maybe this is a bad idea.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_36;Near a stream in the local forests, my men have found Roman Aquilae, eagle standards. Now, even years after the Roman Empire fell, they shine beautifully and must surely be worth much, both in status and pure wealth.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_36;Keep them for status.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_36;I'll sell them to some Roman merchant.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_37;From my long experience as diplomat for my liege, and the many courts I have visited, I have come in touch with many languages and dialects. After years of studying and observing these languages I am now considered to be multilingual.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_37;This will surely be useful.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDES2_EDM_37;Due to having worked as a spy for many years, I have visited many courts and foreign nations, and I've had to master many languages. Now I can speak many languages around the known world, and I am considered to be multilingual.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_38;The terrible rinderpest has struck many cows in [Root.GetName]. In only a few weeks, entire farms worth of cattle has perished, and nobody knows what to do. My advisors say that I should finance a quarantine in the infected places, to make sure this disease doesn't spread.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_38;There is nothing I can do...;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_38;Quarantine the infected cattle!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_39;The rinderpest that plagued [Root.GetName] for many years, has finally been halted. It's now fortunately gone, but most of the cows in [Root.GetName] have perished in this disease. It will take a while before the province will finally have recovered, but for now there is only good news.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_39;Fortunately.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_EDM_40;A nobleman has appeared at the gates of your court. He wants to enter your court, and claims he has a great knowledge of all sorts of potentially important topics. However, it is also risky to let this man join your court, given how much enemies you have among the nobles in the area.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_EDM_40;Welcome him!;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_EDM_40;No, it's too dangerous;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_EDM_40_TT1;The man is a loyal scholar.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_EDM_40_TT2;The man is a disloyal schemer.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
