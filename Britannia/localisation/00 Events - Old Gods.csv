EVTNAME3124500;Restoring the Old Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3124500;Ever since the massacre of the druids on Ynys Mon by the Roman general Svetonius centuries ago, the Brythonic faith has been a shadow of its former self, with foreign religions increasingly taking hold. Much of the ancient knowledge of the druids has been lost, but you have hear rumours of an ancient book, sacrilegious in its very existence yet possibly our faith's saviour...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3124500;We must restore the Old Gods and put an end to this Christian madness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3124500;No... perhaps this is not a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312450;The Book of Caleddin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312450;Your quest to restore the Old Gods of Britain has led you to the discovery of an ancient book. Druidism forbids to write anything down, yet this book seems to contain a detailed record of the old religion: all its secrets, all its rituals, all its meanings and all its power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312450_1;Looking through some of the old family books, you have come across something very pertinent to your current quest. Druidism forbids to write anything down, yet this book seems to contain a detailed record of the old religion: all its secrets, all its rituals, all its meanings and all its power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312450;Very interesting... I have to read this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312450;I am not interested. I will put the book back where I found it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312451;The Book of Caleddin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312451;After weeks of intense study, you are now convinced the lost book of Caleddin has yielded all its secrets to you. A great ritual described in the book could be exactly what you were looking for. If properly performed, it might restore the lost link between men and the Old Gods, and possibly bring the spreading of Christianity to a stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312451;I want to know more about this ritual...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312451;These are no more than peasant superstitions! Enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312452;The Treasures of Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312452;Your quest to find the thirteen Treasures of Britain will require great effort and deep devotion. Combined in the proper ritual, the Treasures are the keys of power, but none of them has power by itself, and they all look like common objects. Finding them will be a tough deed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312452;I am ready to dedicate every available resource to this search!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312452;My duties as a ruler come first, but I will not give up the search...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME312464;The Treasures of Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312464;Your quest to find the thirteen Treasures of Britain has led you to the discovery that one of them, the Sword of Rhydderch Hael, is in truth the sword of Arthur Pendragon, son of King Uther of Dumnonia. Arthur calls the sword 'Excalibur' and he might be unaware of its true origin and power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312464;We must recover the sword at any cost. Steal it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312464;We should ask Arthur for the sword. He will understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312464;This is too dangerous. I have had enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312465;The Treasures of Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312465;Your quest to find the thirteen Treasures of Britain has led you to the discovery that one of them, the Sword of Rhydderch Hael, was more recently known as 'Excalibur' and owned by Arthur Pendragon of Dumnonia, who could have been possibly unaware of the sword's true origin and power. No one has ever seen it since Arthur's death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312465_1;Your quest to find the thirteen Treasures of Britain has led you on the trail of one of the most greatest and most important of all, the Sword of Rhydderch Hael. No one has been sure of its location for many years, but now one of our searchers insist that they have found a solid - if risky - lead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312465;We must recover the sword at any cost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312465;This is too dangerous. I have had enough of this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312466;The Treasures of Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312466;Your quest to find the thirteen Treasures of Britain has led you to the discovery of the current location of the most powerful of them, the Cauldron of Clydno Eiddyn. Unfortunately, the Cauldron's hiding place lies in a territory controlled by our enemies. Recovering the cauldron will be an extremely dangerous task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312466;I will take my ten best warriors and retrieve it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312466;I will send my best men to retrieve it... they will bring it back for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312466;This is too dangerous. Enough with this ridiculous quest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312467;The Treasures of Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312467;Great news! We successfully retrieved the Sword of Rhydderch Hael, also know as 'Excalibur'. Among the thirteen Treasures of Britain, few are of any practical use, but this sword is a magnificent weapon forged in Irish steel, worthy of a King. Even if our quest should fail, we'd still have gained at least one real treasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312467;Excellent! We must not stop now. Keep searching!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312467;Finally... this was the last one! I have gathered them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312468;The Book of Caleddin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312468;The first few pages of the book reveal its origin: three hundred years ago, the Roman Governor of Britain, Svetonius, was eager to learn everything about our religion. He managed to find a traitor druid, Caleddin, who dictated everything he knew to a Roman scribe. Copied in what looks to be execrable Latin, the ancient knowledge of the druids lies in your hands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312468;Excellent! I will study this book with great diligence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312468;This book should not exist! I will destroy it immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312468;I have more important things to do! I will put the book back where I found it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312469;The Book of Caleddin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312469;The ancient ritual described by Caleddin requires the gathering of thirteen objects of great power: the legendary Treasures of Britain. Many people scorn the very existance of the Treasures, while others doubt whether they could have survived centuries of Roman rule. But some say the old Druids, facing defeat, could have hidden them so deep that no Roman would ever find them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312469;I will find the thirteen Treasures of Britain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312469;These are just old stories for children... I am wasting my time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312470;The Treasures of Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312470;Great news! We successfully retrieved the Cauldron of Clydno Eiddyn, the most powerful of the thirteen Treasures of Britain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312470;Excellent! We must not stop now. Keep searching!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312470;Finally... this was the last one! I have gathered them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312471;Honorable [Root.GetTitledName], I have taken your request into consideration. I respect your cause, but I will not yield my sword in the name of a forgotten druidic ritual. I am certain that it will prove more useful against the Saxons invading our lands.\n\nRespectfully,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312471;He will regret this... I will have that sword at any cost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312471;He is right. Enough with this absurd quest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312472;You're not supposed to see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312472;You're not supposed to see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312473;The Treasures of Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312473;After three hundred years the thirteen Treasures of Britain have been gathered once more. We can now prepare ourselves to perform the ancient ritual described in the book of Caleddin. The power of the Treasures will be unleashed, hopefully summoning the Old Gods back to Britain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312473;Good... we shall do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312473;On second thought, I don't want to do this anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312474;The Ancient Ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312474;The ritual is a complicated procedure: the Cauldron of Clydno Eiddyn must be placed in the center of a massive and intricately designed bonfire, and the remaining Treasures laid in circle around it, each one surrounded by its own spiral-shaped hedge of firewood. Building this structure will require considerable manpower...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312474;Our people have faith in the Old Gods! They will answer this call!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312474;Most of our people became Christians... we'll have to recruit paid workers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312474;Force the people to work and if they refuse, kill them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312476;The Ancient Ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312476;Soon we will be performing the ancient ritual described in the book of Caleddin. The great bonfire shall be lit on the night of Samhain, and it shall burn for nine hours before the final ceremony and sacrifice. Your servants are already gathering the massive amount of firewood required. The works on the great bonfire structure will begin after the next harvest, and hopefully be finished just in time for Samhain Eve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312476;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312477;The Ancient Ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312477;The time has almost come! Works have begun on the great wooden structure described in the book of Caleddin.\nIn a few weeks, on Samhain Eve, the greatest fire Britain has ever seen will burn, and the power of the Treasures will be unleashed. Then, hopefully, the Old Gods will return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312477;Finally...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312478;The Ancient Ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312478;At last! It is Samhain Eve, and everything is set. Tonight we will summon the Old Gods back to Britain! Around the great bonfire structure, everyone is watching the sky and praying for good weather, as thick black clouds close in from the west. There is one final part, though: the blood sacrifice. Traditionally, the supreme sacrifice was the son of the ruler...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312478;This fire will burn stronger than rain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312478;I will not tolerate human sacrifice. We will slaughter some livestock...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312478;I will offer to the Gods the life of one of my prisoners!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312478;That robber we captured some days ago... we will sacrifice him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD312478;Just seize some peasants! We will kill a few of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE312478;There is no middle ground. I will offer my own son's life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF312478;On second thought, I don't want to do this anymore...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312479;The Fires of [Root.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312479;The first fire blazed in the innermost ring of the structure just after sunset. The flames caught slowly at first, but then the blaze became brighter and brighter until the light flared huge and triumphant in the night. Nine hours the fire burned. The noise was deafening, the heat unbearable. On the ninth hour the final ceremony was performed: blood filled the Cauldron of Clydno Eiddyn, and life was offered to the Gods. The ritual was done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312479;We did it... what now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME3124800;A Winter Night's Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3124800;A few nights after the ritual, you are asleep alone, and troubled by nightmares. The Gods did not answer your call and the burden of failure is upon you. But then, just before dawn, the dark visions in your sleep turn into distant glimpses of light, and you suddenly feel the striking presence of an ancient truth...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3124800;Is this the voice of Bel in my head?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME3124801;The Old Gods Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3124801;It is all clear to you now. The Gods will not return to walk the Earth once more, but they have sent a sign that they have not forgotten us. Instead, it is our duty as men to reform the faith and follow the will of the Gods once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3124801;Let the rule of the Old Gods begin once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312480;The Ancient Ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312480;The fires burned so fiercely that it was not till two days later that we could retrieve the Cauldron and Excalibur. The other Treasures were lost forever to the flames. The ritual was properly performed, but the Gods did not come. Some say that perhaps nothing was meant to happen right there, perhaps the Gods did hear our call and will answer it sooner or later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312480;Perhaps... or was it all for nothing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312480;No... I killed my own son for this! Something MUST happen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312481;You're not supposed to see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312481;You're not supposed to see this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312482;The Treasures of Britain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312482;The Thirteen Treasures of Britain may have been lost or scattered over the centuries, but some at least have been easy to find. It seems that some of the artifacts have been in your family's possession all along, including the Sword of Rhydderch Hael, which you have realized is your trusty sword Excalibur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB312483;This rubbish can barely hold itself together! Enough with this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312483;Finally... this was the last one! I have gathered them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312489;The Ancient Ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312489;We can no longer sacrifice one of our prisoners during the ritual to summon the Old Gods back to Britain, as we have no more prisoners. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312489;We will slaughter some livestock... it better be enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312489;That robber we captured some days ago... we will kill him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD312489;Just seize some peasants! We can spare a few of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE312489;I am ready for the supreme sacrifice: I will give my son's life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312490;Quest Aborted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312490;Your quest for the treasures has been brought to a sudden end with your imprisonment by [Root.Host.GetTitledName]. May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] grant you freedom, and soon, to continue your quest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC312490_2;As a [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful, you have abandoned your quest to restore the old Brythonic gods. The treasures are nothing to you now but meaningless objects, and the ceremony merely a pagan ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312490_3;Your piety has dropped so low that people are no longer taking your search for treasures seriously. Without their support, you have been forced to call off the quest in disgrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312490_4;It seems that someone else has managed to collect all the Thirteen Treasures of Britain and restore the power of the Old Gods in the great ritual described in the Book of Caleddin.

EVTOPTA312490;This is only a temporary complication! The Old Gods must be restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
