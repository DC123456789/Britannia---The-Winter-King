# EVTDESC_ZOR.10;The land of Sogdia has been purified of barbarian and Arab rulers and will soon be purified of Arab influences.,Now that we completely control the ancient province of Sogdia, a critical frontier,region of all of the great Persian Dynasties, we are in great position to purify the rest of our ancient empire of foreign influences.,Unlike many of other parts of the region this land has always been less settled and still has large tribal ares. It will once again serve as our frontier against the Turks and other nomadic peoples.

# EVTOPTACHE.5;A truly terrifying thought, how do we come closer to the First Intellect?;;;;;;;;;x
# EVTDESCCHE.6;Finally, the priest beings talking about the solution to this major problem.  The solution is the liberation of the soul from the body by ascetic works and proper ritual;;;;;;;x
