EVTOPTA313020;We will conquer these lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313020;No, it is not the right time for an invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### RISE OF LINDSEY ###
EVTNAME313030;Ultimatum to the Britons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313030;[Root.Capital.GetName] has been an Anglo-Saxon settlement for many years now, but it remains under the overlordship of the Briton kingdom of [foederati_suzerain.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. However, our strength has been growing as more and more families arrive from the continent, while the Britons struggle to hold back the tide. Perhaps it is time that we establish our own kingdom here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313030;It is time for the Angles to rule in Lindsey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313030;No, it would be too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313031;Ultimatum from the Angles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313031;The Angles settled in [From.Capital.GetName] have sent us an ultimatum, demanding control over the city of Lindum and all of Linnius as a whole. Should we not accept, they have also reminded us that they have many more warriors ready to fight than we do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313031;We have no choice but to submit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313031;We will not give up what is rightfully ours!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313032;Rise of Lindesege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313032;Recognizing our military superiority, [From.GetTitledName] has accepted our ultimatum and ceded control of the realm over to us. We are now in a position to declare independence and establish our own kingdom of Lindesege, independent from our former British masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313032_1;The traitorious Angle foederati settled in [Root.Capital.GetName] have deposed you and declared the creation the Kingdom of Lindesege over your old realm of Linnius. The new Anglo-Saxon kingdom has quickly consolidated their control over the area, and have let the Brythonic citizens know that the Angles are the masters now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313032_2;The Angles settled in [Root.Capital.GetName] have deposed the High Lord of Linnius and declared the creation the Kingdom of Lindesege in its place. The new Anglo-Saxon kingdom, having rapidly consolidated their control over the area, refuses to swear fealty to us and could become a real threat in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313032_3;The Angles settled in [Root.Capital.GetName] have deposed the High Lord of Linnius and declared the creation the Kingdom of Lindesege in its place. The new Anglo-Saxon kingdom has quickly consolidated their control over the area, and as more settlers from the continent migrate to reinforce and strengthen the kingdom, further oppurtunities for Anglo-Saxon expansion into the weakening British realms of the Midlands are opening up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313032_4;The Angles settled in [Root.Capital.GetName] have deposed the High Lord of Linnius and declared the creation the Kingdom of Lindesege in its place. The new Anglo-Saxon kingdom has quickly consolidated their control over the area, and now has the potential to pose a threat to the neighbouring British realms of Elmet and Ebrauc made newly vulnerable. Meanwhile, other British kingdoms worry about the loyalty of their own foederati - will they be next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313032;Excellent. Let the rule of the Angles commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313032;We will have our revenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313032;Cursed barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313032;Another Angle kingdom rises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313032;This is extremely concerning...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313034;Ultimatum Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313034;[From.GetTitledName] has refused to accept our ultimatum and has even demanded that we submit and surrender immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313034;We will show the Wælisc who is powerful here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313034;Very well then. We have no choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313036;Anglian Foederati Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313036;Unwilling to let us take over peacefully, the Britons have unwisely decided to resist our takeover of Linnius, forcing us to take up arms to take what is ours. Once we have defeated the Britons on the field of battle, we will be in a position to assert our dominance over these lands and establish an Angle kingdom of Lindesege here on the coast of the Midlands, independent of British rule or overlordship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313036_1;The foederati Angles have refused to submit and have instead declared war against us, intending to intending to take what they want by force. Their forces are rapidly mobilizing, and it seems that we have a fully fledged foederati revolt on our hands - one that will determine the fate of Linnius...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313036_2;Our vassal, [From.GetTitledName], has informed us that the Angles of [From.Capital.GetName] have sent an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the realm. The ultimatum was dismissed, but the Angles have now mobilized against us, and they have now staged a fully fledged foederati revolt, intending to take control over the entirety of Linnius...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313036_3;The foederati Angles settled in [From.Capital.GetName] have revolted against the High Lord of Linnius, after an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the realm was refused. War has broken out between the Britons and Angles in Linnius, as the foederati rebel against their masters to establish dominance over the realm. \n\nShould the revolt succeed, this will significantly compromise the British position in the upper Midlands, possibly presenting a possibility for other Anglo-Saxon groups to take advantage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313036_4;The foederati Angles settled in [From.Capital.GetName] have revolted against the High Lord of Linnius, after an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the realm was refused. War has broken out between the Britons and Angles in Linnius, as the foederati rebel against their masters to establish dominance over the realm. \n\nShould the revolt succeed, the fall of Linnius will present a significant setback for the Britons as Elmet and Ebrauc become exposed to Angle raids and invasions, and other British kingdoms are already looking nervously at their own foederati...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313036;We shall be victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313036;To war! We will defend our lands from the barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313036;The barbarians will not take our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313036;The weakling Wælisc will fall easily... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313036;Vile barbarians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF313036;Will we be next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313037;Angles Back Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313037;The Angles have backed down on their ultimatum and submitted to your rule. [From.GetTitledName] has surrendered and is now imprisoned in your dungeon, at your mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313037;A wise choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313038;Rise of Lindesege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313038;The Britons have been defeated and we now rule over Lindum, or Lincylene, as the town is now called. With Anglo-Saxons now in control of the area, we are now in a position to create our own kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313038;The rule of the Angles begins today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313039;Revolt Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313039;The Britons have proven to be stronger than we expected and we have been forced to submit to them once more. Now that the Britons are back in control, we are completely at their mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313039;This will only be a temporary setback...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313040;Revolt Stalemate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313040;The Britons have proven to be stronger than we expected, but they have failed to defeat us on the battlefield either. We have been unable to take control over the region as we wished, but at least now we are no longer under the yoke of the Britons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313040;One day we will succeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### ICLINGAS/MERCIAN INVASION ###
EVTNAME313050;The Iclingas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313050;The Anglo-Saxon tribes are on the move. Not satisfied with the lands already conquered in Lloeygr, Germanic settlers are pushing out from the existing Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the east.

### HWICCIAN INVASION ###
EVTNAME313060;The Hwiccas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313060;Yet another tribe has emerged as the Anglo-Saxons continue to push west. Anglo-Saxon settlers under the tribe of the Hwiccas are pushing out into the lands of the Dobunni tribe, towards the Severn Sea and the highly Romanized cities of the region. The British kingdoms of the area must now prepare to defend their lands from this new tribe pushing deep into the west, seeking to conquer new lands for themselves in the lands they call "Hwicce".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC313064;The invading armies of the Hwiccas have conquered the province of [Root.GetName], and more and more Germanic settlers arrive by the day.\n\nThe local Christian Britons are slowly assimilating into the culture of their new overlords, leaving the Anglo-Saxons in full control of the province, but not before converting them to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313064_1;The invading armies of the Hwiccas have conquered the province of [Root.GetName], and more and more Germanic settlers arrive by the day.\n\nThe local Britons have abandoned their homes and fled the region, leaving the Anglo-Saxons in full control of the province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### RISE OF THE ICLINGAS ###
EVTNAME313070;Revolt for Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313070;Our proud clan is currently but a minor realm, a vassal of [Root.Liege.GetTitledName]. If we are to aspire to the greatness of our ancestors, we must cast off the rule of other tribes and found our own independent kingdom on this land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313070;We are beholden to no one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313071;Rise of the Iclingas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313071;A new clan is rising to prominence in the Midlands of Britannia. The Iclingas, descendants of the Scyldings that once ruled the old Angle kingdom, are quickly rising to power, casting off their lieges and making gains in the region.\n\nBritons and Saxons alike in the heart of Britannia should be wary of this new kingdom, as the Iclingas prepare to conquer all of the borderland marches in the Midlands - a land they call Mercia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME313073;Failed Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME313077;Rise of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313077;The borderlands between the Britons and Saxons have long been divided between many small states, squabbling with each other and posing little threat to the kingdoms elsewhere. However, [Root.GetTitledName] has claimed the region for himself, has now embarked on a campaign to conquer and unify the many kingdoms here.\n\nBritons and Saxons alike in the heart of Britannia should be wary of this new rising kingdom, as they prepare to conquer all of the borderland marches in the Midlands - a land they call Mercia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME313086;Jutish Foederati Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313086;Unwilling to let us take over peacefully, the Britons have unwisely decided to resist our takeover of Cantuaria, forcing us to take up arms to take what is ours. Once we have defeated the Britons on the field of battle, we will be in a position to assert our dominance over these lands and establish an Angle kingdom of Cantwaras here on the coast of southern Britannia, independent of British rule or overlordship. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end for the Britons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313086_1;The foederati Jutes have refused to submit and have instead declared war against us, intending to intending to take what they want by force. Their forces are rapidly mobilizing, and it seems that we have a fully fledged foederati revolt on our hands - one that will determine the fate of Cantuaria, and perhaps much of Lloegyr as a whole...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313086_2;Our vassal, [From.GetTitledName], has informed us that the Jutes of Ynys Tanatus have sent an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the realm.

EVTDESC313086_3;The foederati Jutes settled in Ynys Tanatus have revolted against the King of Cantuaria, after an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the realm was refused. War has broken out between the Britons and Angles in Ebrauc, as the foederati rebel against their masters to establish dominance over the realm. \n\nShould the revolt succeed, this will be a major coup for the Anglo-Saxons, bringing the Jutes to power for the first time and opening up southeast Britannia to increased settlement and invasion. Regardless of the outcome, this revolt will pave the way for the rise of other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313086_4;The foederati Jutes settled in Ynys Tanatus have revolted against the King of Cantuaria, after an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the realm was refused.

And this may not be the last revolt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### DECLINE OF SUSSEX ###
EVTNAME313091;A Brewing Storm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313091;Cerdic's conquests brought the Kingdom of the South Saxons to glory and power, but the Jutes of Cantware and the other subjugated tribes have never quite fully accepted our rule. With the end of Cerdic's reign, the other tribes are becoming restless and agitating against our rule while we struggle to hold the kingdom together. It is only a matter of time before the first revolts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313091;Let them come and try...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313091TT;We will face instability in our realm and revolts from our vassals until §Y20 years§! have passed or we have lost all of our outlying vassals outside of Sussex proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313093;We have managed to persevere through the storms and revolts of the last several years with our realm at least partially intact. It seems that the rebellious tribes have now exhausted themselves and have acquiesed to the reality of South Saxon rule, at least for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313093;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313094;The Jutes of Cantware and the Saxons of the West reign free once more, and the dream of South Saxon dominance over Ænglaland is more distant than ever.

EVTOPTA313094;One day, we will rise again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### COLLAPSE OF ANGLIA ###
EVTNAME313101;The Death of Aelle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313101;King Aelle of Anglia has taken his last breath, and thus his rule over Anglia has ended. His claim to the title of Bretwalda held together the diverse tribes of Angles and Saxons in their struggle to carve out a homeland - now his death heralds a bleaker period and more divided period for the Saxon peoples. Across his former lands his vassals now reject the new king, preferring to look in amongst themselves for strength. Though these rebellious types seek to be kings in their own right, it is possible still that his heir will earn his rule once more through strength and cunning, bringing the rebellious sorts to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313101;Anglia must remain strong, in honour of the great king!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313101;Perhaps this is our chance for power and independence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313101;A great king and warrior has died...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313101;Perhaps this will stop the barbarians' advance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313101;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313103;The Deposition of Aelle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313103;Aelle of Anglia has been cast from his throne, and thus his rule of Anglia has ended. His claim to the title of Bretwalda having made him the greatest King of the Saxon Shore, he now lives destitute, his legacy the mockery of those who have taken his crown. His fall has opened up divisions amongst the Saxons, and now his former vassals squabble amongst one another, unable to agree the legitimacy of the new King. Now looking in amongst themselves for strength, new rebels in Anglia are ignoring the rule of law that Aelle had upheld, though it is possible that his successor will earn his rule once more through strength and cunning, bringing the rebellious sorts to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313103;A new era begins in Anglia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313103;Perhaps this is our chance for power and independence...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313103;A great king is no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313103;Perhaps this infighting will stop the barbarians' advance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313103;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313104;Under Aelle, Anglia was a strong and unified kingdom, but now the kingdom is fraught with division. Vassals are scheming left and right and some have even directly questioned your rights to the Kingdom of Anglia. It is only a matter of time before present a direct challenge to your power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313104;We must stop this before it gets out control!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313105;Unlike his predecessor Aelle, [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] has failed to gain the confidence of the vassals he rules over, and many are beginning to question his authority over the Kingdom of Anglia. Many of them have banded together to declare their independence, not recognizing him as their true overlord, and have invited you to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313105;This is an excellent opportunity for independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313105;[Root.Liege.GetFirstName] is the rightful king of Anglia and our rightful overlord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313106;A large number of disaffected Anglian warriors have gathered in [Root.Capital.GetName], promising to help you in your fight for independence against the King of Anglia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313106;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313107;Fall of Anglia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313107;Once a great Anglo-Saxon kingdom and one of the most powerful realms in Britannia, the Kingdom of Anglia has fallen to internal infighting. Unable to keep the kingdom together, King [Root.GetFirstName] has been defeated by his vassals and forced to abdicate from the throne, dissolving the kingdom.\n\nWithout a unifying realm ruling over them all, the different groups within the former kingdom have begun to form new national identities. The East Saxons to the south are establishing their own identity independent of Anglia while the Angles settled in the west are beginning to consider themselves "Mercians", and only the East Angles still consider themselves part of Anglia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313107;We will remember their treachery...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313107;The Anglian domination has ended! It is time for us to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313107;Hah! Let the barbarians fight among themselves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313107;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313108;With no side gaining a clear advantage, you have agreed to a white peace and a truce with your vassals. While you have held your kingdom together for now, you have still not gained the respect of your vassals, and soon they could rise up once more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313108;We will must stay strong and vigilant against the traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313109;With neither side being truly defeated, we have agreed to a white peace and a truce with [Root.Liege.GetTitledName]. While Anglia remains under his yoke, he has not gained the confidence of his vassals, who are still scheming to gain their independence as soon as their truce ends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313109;Next time we will succeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313110;Having decisively crushed your rebellious vassals on the battlefield, they have been forced to bend to your rule once more, and those who did not revolt have been quick to reaffirm their allegiance. You are now recognized as the undisputed King of Anglia, and those that opposed you are now completely at your mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313110_1;We have bought some respite with our decisive victories, but there is still much resentment about our overlordship among our vassals. While some are beginning to recognize our right to all of Anglia it will take more work before we are truly recognized as the proper heirs of Aelle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313110;Excellent. Let that be an example to any else plotting against me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313110;And we will prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313111;Your forces have been crushed and you have been forced to kneel to [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] once more. With your bid for independence crushed, you have been forced to recognized as [Root.Liege.GetTitledName] your rightful overlord, and you are now completely at his mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313111_1;Despite overwhelming support from the vassal tribes we have been defeated by the armies of [Root.Liege.GetTitledName]. While many of [Root.GetHerHis] vassal chiefs and tribes remain restless some are coming around to [Root.GetHerHis] claim as the rightful king of all Anglia, and it may be that one more decisive battle will confirm [Root.GetHerHis] rule for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313111;One day, we will be successful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313111;We will not be defeated again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC313303;Another wave of longboats full of Germanic settlers approaches the eastern shores of Britain. They are expected to land near the fortified town of Venta Icenorum, in the province of Went. The British kingdoms of the east must prepare to defend their lands once more from these Anglian invaders from across the sea, who are apparently determined to conquer new lands for themselves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME3122101;The Great Dyke of [Root.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3122101;The Anglo-Saxon rulers of central Britain have erected a massive earthwork along their western border, from the hills of Kenceaster in the south, to the crossing of the river Severn near Wroxeter in the north. The defensive structure is a statement of power, and will protect Anglo-Saxon lands from the native Britons still ruling in the deep valleys of Gwynedd and Powys.\n\nThis great barrier effectively seperates the Anglo-Saxon territories from the remaining British lands in the west, firmly dividing the island in two. With the loss of their heartlands, the Britons have now effectively ended the old elective system of Britannia, and now sturggle for dominance over the remaining lands that they call 'Cymru'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### RETURN OF THE SAXONS ###
EVTDESC313151;Reports have reached your court of a considerable excitement spreading amongst the now-subjugated Anglo-Saxon inhabitants of Britannia. While no one seems to be quite sure what exactly is the cause of all this, all agree that this has surprisingly made the Anglo-Saxons more peaceable and submissive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313151_1;Rumours are spreading like wildfire among the Anglo-Saxon people of Britannia. While it is spoken of in only the quietest of whispers, you have managed to gleam that [Root.GetDynName] is gathering a large warband back on the continent and seems to be organizing some sort of plot to free us from the British yoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313151;Interesting. I'm sure it is nothing important though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313151TT;All Anglo-Saxon provinces get the §YAnglo-Saxons Pacified§! modifier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME313152;The Saxon Armada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313152;An enormous fleet has landed on the coast of [anglo_saxon_return_invader_target_province.GetName], unloading a massive Germanic warhost the size of which has perhaps never been seen before.  They are under the command of [anglo_saxon_return_invader.GetDynName], who has apparently spent the last several years recruiting exiles and adventurers from the continent and has vowed to reconquer the kingdoms of [anglo_saxon_return_invader.GetHerHis] ancestors and claim the entirety of Britannia for the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nIn a seemingly coordinated action, bands of Saxons have risen up all over the island, creating widespread chaos and disrupting the Britons as they scramble to organize their defences. Does this second Adventus mark a new era of an Anglo-Saxon Aenglaland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313152;[This.Religion.GetHighGodName] shall grant us victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313152;Let's see how this goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC313152;[Root.GetSheHeCap] actually did it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD313152;No! This can't be happening again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE313152;This is worrying news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME313154;The Return of the Saxons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313154;The Anglo-Saxon rebellion has been victorious! The Germanic armies overwhelmed the British defenders who were forced to completely abandon [Root.Capital.Kingdom.GetName], and in celebration of this victory [Root.GetDynName] has been acclaimed Bretwalda over all Aenglaland in the great hall of [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nThe new Bretwalda has vowed not to rest until every last Anglo-Saxon province has been liberated from British rule, and has already been making aggressive overtures towards [Root.GetHerHis] neighbouring realms. As the Britons lick their wounds and watch the Bretwalda's still-massive warbands warily, many wonder if this will be the [Root.GetManWoman] to do what generations before [Root.GetHerHim] could not and destroy the power of the Britons once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313154;The Age of the Saxons has returned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313154;Well, let them have their fun again I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME313158;The Defeat of the Saxons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313158;The early victories of the Bretwalda gave them great hope, but ultimately it was not to be. The Britons rallied and exploited the divisions amongst them, and now the last of the revived Anglo-Saxon kingdoms have now been destroyed, their kings forced to flee back across the sea or bend the knee to their renewed British masters. The old dream of an Anglo-Saxon Aenglaland has now well and truly been crushed and buried, and those that still watch the Eastern Sea are content in the knowledge that nothing will ever be able to truly conquer Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC313158_1;The hopes of the Saxons were dashed against the coast of [anglo_saxon_return_invader_target_province.GetName], as the Britons rallied and defeated the great warhost in some of the largest battles that Britannia has seen in centuries. What warriors remained have fled back to Germania in humiliation or disappeared into the villages from where they came, fearing retribution from the vengeful British. The old dream of an Anglo-Saxon Aenglaland has now well and truly been crushed and buried, and those that still watch the Eastern Sea are content in the knowledge that the nothing will ever conquer Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA313158;May those barbarians never return. Ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB313158;And the British yoke returns...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Only time will tell if the new [bretwalda_heir.GetKingQueen] [bretwalda_heir.GetFirstName] will be able to live up to the feats and expectations of [bretwalda_heir.GetHerHis] predecessor, or if it will be up to another king to take up the mantle as lord over the Anglo-Saxons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320202;The reign of Bretwalda [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] has ended, and with it [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] hegenomy over the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Already many of the other kings have taken the opportunity to break away from [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] hegemony, claiming that their oaths were personally to Bretwalda [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] and [FromFromFrom.GetHerHim] alone.\n\nOnly time will tell if another king will be able to rise up above the fray to unite the fractious Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and reclaim the title of Bretwalda once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA320202;[FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] did not deserve the honour anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC320204;With the loss of territory and control over [Root.GetHerHis] subject kings, the authority of the Bretwalda of Ænglaland has collapsed to the point where [Root.GetSheHe] cannot be seriously considered to hold imperium over the Kings of the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nWithout the support of his subjects and vassals, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has been declared unfit for the prestigious title, and from this moment on will no longer be recognized as Bretwalda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
