BM_COEL_HEN_DESC;The last pretence of Roman rule has left Britain, and with it leaves the certainty of Imperial rule. The Kings and Warlords of Britain must look to their defences, with the brutish Gaels and Picts becoming ever more daring in their raids, and with the former Saxon foederati - once trusted as the greatest mercenaries Roman gold could buy - now baying for blood due to the lack of money and supplies that were once plentiful. With countless petty rulers squabbling over the anarchic regions of the south, does Britain's salvation now depend on the mighty Coel Hen, ruler of the north, former Roman governor and King of all Cumbrians?\n\nWarning: This bookmark is currently a work in progress and is neither fully balanced nor fleshed out.

BM_THE_WINTER_KING;The Winter King;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_WINTER_KING_DESC;December 3rd, 479 AD. On a cold winter night, a clubfooted child is born in Durnovaria. His name is Mordred, son of Mordred, and he is the only legitimate heir of King Uther Pendragon of Dumnonia. In the continent, the Roman Empire has just collapsed, but its political and military presence was withdrawn from the island of Britain almost 70 years before. The resulting vacuum was promptly filled by tribes of Anglo-Saxons coming from northern Germany, who are now competing for land and power with the kingdoms of southern Britain, and still landing in great numbers on what is known as "The Anglo Saxon Shore". The northern kingdoms of Britain are plagued by constant raiding warbands of Picts and Scots from the north, while the coastal provinces of Wales are stormed by Irish raiders who declare themselves kings in the conquered lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_ENEMY_OF_GOD;Enemy of God;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ENEMY_OF_GOD_DESC;Following a hard-fought victory in battle against Powys and Siluria, Arthur appears to have at last won the unity of the British Kingdoms. His forces now turned to face the Saxon threat, Dumnonia and its allies face an enemy that grows with each passing season. The great borderlands of Cynwidion and the Chiltern Hills have finally capitulated to Aelle's might, leaving a long and treacherous border at the mercy of enemy raids. Having broken his vow to travel personally to aid Benoic against the terrifying might of Clovis' Franks, Arthur has permitted the devastating fall and sack of Ynys Trebes, leaving the Franks to rule over Benoic and Soissons as part of the new Kingdom of Neustria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_EXCALIBUR;Excalibur;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EXCALIBUR_DESC;Arthur has crushed Lancelot's rebellion, but at a cost. Guinevere's betrayal has left him reeling, and his Saxon enemies seek to destroy him while he is weak. Chaos threatens to engulf Britain. Yet Arthur is a military genius and noble leader. As the battle draws close, he prepares to fight his way to victory at Mount Badon and win back the woman he lost. But in this final journey of the warlord, the intrigues of Mordred, now the adult heir to the throne of Britain, and the magics of the priestess Nimue could prove to be Arthur's downfall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_EXCALIBUR_ERA_INFO;Arthur has crushed Lancelot's rebellion, but at a cost. Guinevere's betrayal has left him reeling, and his Saxon enemies seek to destroy him while he is weak.

BM_CAMLANN;The Battle of Camlann;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_CAMLANN_DESC;The treacherous Mordred has finally been defeated and killed on the sands of Camlann, but at great cost. Out of all of Arthur's great warriors, only Derfel survives to see the aftermath, casting Excalibur into the sea to ensure that it will never be used again. Already the Saxons are beginning to rebuild with the lack of a strong British king, and as the ambitious Meurig sweeps into the aftermath to claim Dumnonia, the mortally wounded Arthur and his family sail off into the sunset upon the Prydwen, the Once and Future King never to be seen again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DEATH_CLOVIS;The Death of Clovis;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DEATH_CLOVIS_DESC;Clovis, the great Frankish conqueror and defender of his adopted Nicene faith, has died. His kingdom divided in Frankish custom, Clovis's four sons now vie for supremacy, fighting and maneuvering to establish their hegemony against each other while presenting a united threat to foreign kingdoms beyond. Meanwhile, to the south, the Visigoths are slowly rebuilding after their devastating defeat at Vouillé with their king Amalaric under the "guidance" of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great, and further east, the Kingdom of the Burgundians faces an ominous threat from the Frankish kings as their mother, Clotilde, seeks revenge for Gundobad's murder of her father.;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BRIDGE_OF_SWORDS;The Bridge of Swords;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_BRIDGE_OF_SWORDS_DESC;Arthur's victory at Mount Baddon may have checked the Anglo-Saxons' advance for a generation, but that peace is fading fast. His life's work undone by lesser men seeking to gain power in the fray, the Anglo-Saxons are advancing once more into the heart of Britannia. Weak and divided in the face of an increasingly determined enemy, the Britons struggle to hold on to their lands as province after province falls to the Germanic invaders. Spreading just as quickly is Christianity, pushing into the valleys of Powys and Gwynedd as paganism continues to decline across all of Western Europe and Derfel Cadarn, the last of the great Arthurian heroes, is killed in a Saxon raid on the monastery of Dinnewrac, crossing the Bridge of Swords to meet his friends and family once more.\nWarning: This bookmark is currently a work in progress and county history and balancing is not fully finished.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1;Uther Pendragon, once an icon of strength and leadership, is now a weakened old fool living away his final weeks as sickness slowly overcomes him. His only legitimate son, Mordred, has died fighting the Saxons in Lloegyr, and Uther now lingers before the grave in the knowledge that his kingdom and legacy will be continued by a clubfooted infant - his grandson known also as Mordred. Uther's estranged bastard son campaigns in Armorica, and should Uther neither survive nor make peace with Arthur then his realm may be plunged into a conflict that could cost it dearly in the endless struggle for Britain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2;Merlin, despite his age, is a man feared by the people of Britain. Known as one of the most powerful Druids of the age, Merlin's command of magic and Druidic lore would make even a battle hardened Saxon reluctant to draw his sword. Merlin has been absent from his home at Ynys Wydryn for some time, and only the Gods know where he has travelled, and for what purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3;Arthur Pendragon, the bastard son of Uther, King of Dumnonia, is a man of many virtues and many flaws. Banished from Dumnonia after the death of Uther's only legitimate son, Mordred, in battle, Arthur now serves in the court of King Ban of Benoic across the sea in Armorica. With his father ailing, however, Arthur will soon have to return from Armorica to serve as regent to his infant nephew, Mordred ap Mordred, and must either hold together his nephew's realm, or take other steps to secure it against the inevitable Saxon onslaught.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_5;Mordred is the only legitimate heir of Uther of Dumnonia, and seemingly the last bulwark keeping Dumnonia independent from those who would seek to dismember it. His young age and cursed appearance considered a bad omen, Mordred will endure a tultumous childhood and must choose his allies well if he is to defend his crown from those who would deprive him of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_14;A pious man, Tewdric of Gwent descends from the highest of Roman nobility, ruling the most civilised portion of Britain following the Roman withdrawal. Having embraced the Christian faith of the continent, Tewdric would prefer to spread the word of Christ to lifting a sword, even if this is at the expense of his allies and his people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_16;Proud and stubborn would surely summarise Gorfyddyd of Powys to any messenger or courtesan ever unfortunate enough to be brought before him. Though his intentions are neither especially good nor malicious, Gorfyddyd cares more for his Kingdom and his legacy than for the feelings and lives of others. Desperate to marry his daughter Ceinwyn, the Star of Powys and one of the most beautiful women in Britain, Gorfyddyd is surely a ripe target for many as an ally, or indeed someone who could easily become an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_17;The son of Gorfyddyd, Cuneglas presents a friendlier face to the forces of Arthur and his allies, despite their hand in the death of his father and Arthur's personal insult to his sister, Ceinwyn. Saxons now mass upon the edge of Powys, and Cuneglas must act quickly if he is to safeguard Pengwern from their westward march.;;;;;;;;;;;;x	
ERA_CHAR_INFO_28;The heir of Tewdric, Meurig inherited the throne of Gwent upon his father's abdication to live a peaceful life as a monk among his beloved books. Unlike his father, however, Meurig cares little for the alliance of British kings, believing that their faith in God will protect them against the Saxons. Sending missionaries into Anglia, refusing to help Arthur, and above all championing the Christian faith, Meurig schemes his way to power, looking hungrily at the precarious throne of Dumnonia and the ultimate prize - the High Kingship of Britannia itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_31;Lancelot, the former heir of Benoic, is a man acclaimed by the bards and storytellers. His newly found position as King of Siluria - awarded in compensation for the loss of Benoic - would be just if it was not for the sheer absurdity in calling Lancelot anything but a liar and a coward. His true nature known to few, Lancelot schemes endlessly against his allies and his family, clutching at power whenever it is presented to him. Despite his animosity to his brother Galahad and to Arthur's comrade Derfel, Lancelot now sits unchallenged in Siluria, biding his time until he can amass the power and respect he believes he deserves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_80;Bretwalda is what they are calling him, though the title is perhaps premature. Aelle of Anglia is a mighty warlord of the Angles who has already made a name for himself in the distant land of Angeln - home of these rough foreigners. Claiming to be the King of all Britain, Aelle seeks to make his dream a reality in the face of competition from the bloodthirsty Cerdic and the valiant Britons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_86;Cerdic the Black is perhaps the most terrifying of all the Saxons who have ever set foot on Britain's shores. Having systematically destroyed the Britons of Ceint and Rhegin, Cerdic has consolidated his control over all the Anglo-Saxons south of the Thames and has now turned his envious gaze solely on Dumnonia, his raids penetrating far enough as to threaten every Briton from the borderlands to the Severn.;;;;;;;;;;;x	
ERA_CHAR_INFO_300;Coel Hen, according to early Welsh tradition, was a leader in Roman or Sub-Roman Britain and the progenitor of many of the Kingly lines in Hen Ogledd - the Old North of modern day northern England and southern Scotland. Coel's association with Northern Britain has led to the belief that he was the last of the "Duces Brittaniarum", otherwise rendered as "Duke of the Britons". These generals were selected amongst the numerous Roman loyalists in Britain to defend the coast of Britain from the increasing raids of Picts, Gaels and Saxons. Coel made his capital at Eburacum - modern day York - and oversaw the transition from direct Roman rule to an independent Britain which took care of its own defence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1004;Cunedda Wledig, son of Edern, took the Kingship of Gwynedd in the 390's following the death of Custennin Fawr, son of the Emperor Magnus Maximus. Originally from Manaw Goddodin, modern day Clackmannshire in Scotland, Cunedda was said to have come from a family of Roman loyalists on the far fringes of the Empire, his ancestor Padarn being known as "Beisrudd" for the Scarlet robe he wore in service of Rome. Cunedda successfully held off the Irish invaders plaguing the coast of Wales and while Gwynedd was divided among his sons upon his death, the kingdom he built up remained a powerful force in Wales, maintaining Roman traditions as best as they could and providing a serious threat and buffer to the Anglo-Saxons before finally being conquered in the 13th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1010;Vortigern, King of Pagenses and later High King of Britannia, lived a life of infamy - leading to his acceptance as one of the most hated men in Britain. Making his power base in the areas of Britain untouched by serious Roman influence, Vortigern dedicated his life towards the pursuit of the High Kingship, eventually being acclaimed as such by around 425. Vortigern has often been associated with the "Great Tyrant", inviting the foreigners Hengist and Horsa to aid him in fighting the invading Picts and Gaels, and eventually leading to permenant Saxon rule in Britain. Vortigern's descendants continued to rule in Powys and Buellt after his death, eventually fading from history as the scourge of Saxon conquest - brought upon by Vortigern himself - erased the glories of Briton kingship from Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1089;The son of the Romano-Gallic general Aegidius, Syragius inherited the Roman rump state in Northern Gaul that his father had created and successfully defended after the murder of the Roman Emperor Majorian. He ruled and defended the Domain of Soissons, maintaining Roman rule in Gaul even after the last Roman Emperor was deposed in 480. This was not to last, however, and in 486 he was defeated by King Clovis of the Franks. His domain was annexed into the Frankish realm and the last of the Romans in Western Europe was executed soon after.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1100;Suceeding his father Childeric I as King of the Salian Franks at the age of 15, Clovis quickly proved himself to be an able warrior and conqueror. Over some 25 years of campaigning, he managed to unite all the Franks under a single king and defeat both the Romans and the Visigoths, extending Frankish rule over almost all of Gaul. He also converted to Nicene Christianity at the instigation of his wife, ensuring its dominance over Western Europe for the next several centuries. By the time of his death in 511, he had laid the foundations of what would eventually become the French state and is recognized as the first King of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1112;The youngest son of Clovis, Clotaire I received Soissons and the old territory of the Salian Franks as his inheritance upon his father's death. An ambitious ruler, he sought to enlarge his domain through both war and intrigue, participating in Frankish campaigns against the Burgundians, Visigoths, Thuringians, and Ostrogoths as well as executing the children of his brother Chlodomer to ensure his inheritance of his lands. Ultimately outliving all his brothers and their descendants, Clotaire managed to reunify all of the Frankish lands until his death, when the Frankish realm was partioned once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1512;Inheriting the throne at an early age, King Morgan "Thunderbolt" was likely the last Celtic king of Bryneich. The leati of Bryneich revolted in 547, taking control of the coast, but Morgan continued to resist from further inland. Lead by King Urien Rheged, a grand alliance of nearly all the Cumbric kingdoms assembled to fight the invaders in the late 6th century, driving the Angles out of Bebbanburg and besieging them in Lindisfarne, very nearly destroying the nascent kingdom of Bernicia. Wary of Urien's power, however, Morgan then had Urien assassinated, destroying the alliance in infighting and almost single-handedly destroying any hope defeating the Anglo-Saxons in the north. Over the next few years almost all the kingdoms of the Old North would fall to the newly formed kingdom of Northumbria.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1633;Flavius Claudius Constantinus, otherwise known as Constantine III, proclaimed himself Western Roman Emperor in Britannia in 407, the last in a series of usurpers from the province as the Empire disintegrated in the face of Germanic invaders. In 408 Constantine invaded Gaul and successfully defeated the loyalist armies summoned against him, and was recognized as co-emperor by Honorius by 409. By 410, however, a new usurper had risen in Hispania to contest his rule and the Romano-Britons expelled his officials, feeling that he had abandoned them as Saxon pirates raided Britain. Encircled by enemies and defeated in a desperate gamble to win control of Italy, Constantine and his son Constans were defeated in 411 and executed. While Roman rule was eventually restored to Gaul and Hispania, never again would the legions return to Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1637;Called the last of the Romans in Britain, Aurelius Ambrosius was a powerful warlord in Sub-Roman Britain, feared even by High King Vortigern. From what may have been his power base in the highly romanized area of Dobunnia, he led the pro-Roman faction of Britannia in opposing Vortigern's plans to settle Saxon mercenaries in Britannia, ultimately culminating in the Battle of Guoloph, or Wollop. While Ambrosius died of the plague in the chaos of the Saxon Revolt a few years later, his son Ambrosius Aurelianus would later unite the Britons once more and lead them in their fight against the Saxons, holding them off for a generation and possibly inspiring the enduring legend of King Arthur.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1700;A great-grandson of Cunedda, Maelgwm Gwynedd ruled one of the most powerful kingdoms of Wales, bearing the fruits of his ancestors' labours in driving out the Irish. He held pre-eminence over the kingdoms of Wales and may have been recognized as High King of Britannia, being called "the dragon of the island". Dying in the "yellow plague" in 547, probably the arrival of the Plague of Justinian in Britain, Maelgwm is considered the founder of the royal family of medieval Gwynedd.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1736;Likely a descendent of Ambrosius Aurelianus, Aurelius Caninus was king over his ancestral kingdom of the Dobunni, ruling over the still heavily-Romanized and largely urban cities of Glevum, Corinium, and Aquae Sulis. Notable enough to be castigated by Glidas, being called a "lion's whelp" and accused of murders, fornications, and adulteries, he was nevertheless turned into a High King by Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regnum Historiae. He was, however, likely one of the last kings of a united Glouvia, with his Romanized kingdom slowly devolving into a traditional Celtic kingship and probably breaking up a generation after his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
