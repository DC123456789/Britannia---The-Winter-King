#################
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR1A;While dining with some acquaintances the conversation turns towards the slow breakdown in civic life. The remaining few decurions on the city council have apparently been failing to maintain the theatre. After the dinner ends one of your courtiers beseechs you to help preserve the civic life of  [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR1B;As you stroll down the main thoroughfare in [Root.Capital.GetName] there is suddenly a frenzy of activity. A local indigent beggar charges through your line of guards and kisses your feet in an effort to get his petition heard. He claims that due to poor upkeep the town baths are permanently closed which means he has nowhere warm to sleep at night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR1C;While watching a group of barbarians being put to death for stealing marble from the dilapidated amphitheatre, you suddenly feel an overwhelming feeling of sadness. How did the building fall into such disrepair?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR1D;As your entourage canters down the old Roman road, a lone mile marker catches your eye. It is from the reign of Vespasian himself, though Time has long since blanketed it with weeds. You pause briefly, the ephemerality of human existence weighing heavily on your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR1;This is an affront to Roman honor. Something must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR1;We have no right to squander the gifts granted by our forefathers. We rebuild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR1;We should make structures from human flesh in future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR1;Such confused times we live in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR2;While walking through the forum with an escort of buccelarii, you hear frenzied shouting from down the street. A beer-sodden barbarian is charging straight towards you with his hand outstretched. "Orders, dominus!?" shouts one of your guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR2;This is clearly just a misunderstanding. Lower the weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR2;He's gone savage. Put him down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR2;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR3;The man comes to a stop in front of the guardsmen, suddenly becoming aware of his manic appearance. He apologises profusely, explaining that he was merely soliciting gold in his native tongue. He offers you his service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR3;There's plenty of gold in my employ, amicus. Come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR3;I grant you mercy, but a beggar can offer me nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR3;Beer sodden barbarians are useless to me. Have this swine flogged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR4A;One of your spearmen lunges forward and stabs the man in the chest, bringing him down. An elaborately decorated bronze comb, presumably a memento of a royal life beyond the old frontier, slips from his clothes and lands at your feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR4B;An archer in your employ opens fire on the oncoming man, immediately killing him. One of your guards rifles through the man's clothes and discovers an ostentatious dagger, presumably a ceremonial trinket. The barbarian had no intent of selling it even in his destitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR4;Return that to his family along with a sack of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR4;That trinket is payment enough for the dishonor he has shown me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR4;Justice for Roma Aeterna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR5A;While staying at your country villa you become aware of some severe damage to one of your prize mosaics depicting the Saints Simplicius, Faustinus and Beatrix. The vilicus who manages the estate informs you that there isn't a single specialist left in the area who could repair it and recommends you cover it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR5B;While staying at your country villa you become aware of some severe damage to one of your prize mosaics depicting the seduction of Anchises by Venus on Mount Ida. The vilicus who manages the estate informs you that there isn't a single specialist left in the area who could repair it and recommends you cover it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR5;It was a waste of money anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR5;We'll just have to go further afield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR5;That was my ancestor's favorite mosaic. Spare no expense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR5;Where's the blood and gore? Do Titanomachy or Iliupersis instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR6;"Do you think the legions will ever return to our shores [Root.GetTitledFirstName]!?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR6;Of course. They would never abandon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR6;We can take care of ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR6;The sun has set on the empire of the Romans. We're on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR6;Get out of my sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR7A;The more you read about the virtues of old Rome under its pagan gods, the more you start to question your own faith. Could it really be that the Eternal City was sacked due to the abandonment of ancestral customs as they say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR7B;Out of curiosity you have been browsing the treatises of Christian writers to see what they say about your cult practices. They argue that the wanton desecration of the temples has gone unpunished for so long because the Christian God is all powerful. Could that really be true?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR7;Just a foolish pagan superstition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR7;I suppose it could make sense...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR7;Galilean nonsense. All of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR8A;While relaxing with some friends at a private dinner, one of your slave girls, a pretty little thing from Germania, knocks an amphora of wine over one of the guests. She runs over to you and begins to kiss your feet obeisantly. "Dominus it was an accident".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR8B;As you demand more stuffed dormice for one of your banquet guests, one of your slave girls from beyond the wall of Hadrian knocks a bust over nearly injuring one of your distinguished friends. The room goes deathly quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR8;No harm done eh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR8TT;You send the ancilla back to the slave quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR8;Why are slaves so useless?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR8TT;You send the ancilla to the majordomo for ten lashes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR8;You are going to regret that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR8TT;You order the ancilla to wait inside your bedchambers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR8;Feed her to Argus and Cerberus in the kennels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR8TT;You send the ancilla out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR9;As you walk through your villa you suddenly stop in the hallway. You retrace your steps and stare at one of the mosaics in the atrium. You have never seen it from this angle before and it looks... different, somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR9;It looks awful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR9;Only fools spend money on overpriced mosaics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR9;That troop formation looks woefully inaccurate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR9;Only now do I understand the imagery. Fascinating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR10;As you and your entourage return home from a trip, you notice a large covered carriage stuck in the mud where the old Roman road has disintegrated. The merchant in charge bows upon sighting your clothes and apologises for blocking the way, blaming the lack of maintenance to the network in recent years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR10TT;You and your men attempt to skirt around the mud by the sides of the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR10;We'll just have to go the long way round.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR10;Well we can't go over it, we can't go under it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR10TT;You take your men through the mud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR10;This is an ambush! Kill them all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR10TT;The bugle sounds and your guards attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR10;Network?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR10TT;You prove yourself wise in the eyes of your peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR11;What do we have here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR11;From the carriage suddenly bursts an host of armed men. They are clearly bandits, rife as such men are in these uncertain times. Your guards swiftly prevail against the foolhardy vagrants, butchering each of them. You move to the wagon to see what they have stolen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR11TT;Your soldiers open the carriage doors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR12;You peer inside the carriage and see an almost comically large stack of gold plate and coins, many of them valuable solidi. What sort of madmen would take their stash with them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR12TT;Your men begin loading up the coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR13;Your guards drag a woman out of the carriage. She fiercely resists and shouts in all manner of languages from the East. She eventually recognises that you are nobility from your cloak and entourage and calms down. The bandits appear to have enslaved her, but with little intention of a quick sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR13;You are welcome to come with us domina.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR13TT;You help her onto a horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR13TT;You order your men to brand the easterner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR13;A learned noble should fetch a substantial price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR13;Nothing like a woman after a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR13TT;Your soul goes to dark places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR13;Do you speak Greek, gun??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR13TT;You speak to the easterner in the Greek language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR14;Your designs on the nun ultimately came to naught and you were severely injured in her attempt to escape your advances. Your men take you to the nearest shelter available and attempt to stitch your wounds, but it is not a sure thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR14TT;You pray to whatever gods are listening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR14;This is not justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR14;And that's what happens...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR14TT;This doesn't bother you as much as you thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR14TT;You... wait what. Why would you do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR14;You stitch like somebody with mortus comitialis, I'll do it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR15;The woman is astounded to meet someone speaking Greek in such a place and her mood changes immediately. She reveals that she was a pilgrim who has been in the bandits' custody for several weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR15;We'll get you to a nice warm fire and some food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR15TT;I think we could all we do with that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR15;It sure will be nice to have someone to discuss Homer with!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR15;Stab stab stab!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR16;As you move towards the carriage a gigantic bear slashes its way through the doors and charges at you, scattering your panicking men. The bear slashes at your gut exposing its belly to your steel, allowing you dispatch it in one quick slice. As you slip into unconsciousness, all you can think to ask is why was there a bear inside the carriage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR16;The bear... the bear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR16TT;You sure showed that bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR17;As you navigate the damaged section of road suddenly an arrow whistles past your head from behind. Bogged down in the mud you attempt to turn back around but an arrow pierces your side knocking you down. The attackers are routed by your guards, with the "merchant" being the last of the bandits to surrender. You turn your attention to the carriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR17;What do we have here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR17TT;Your soldiers open up the carriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR18;You decapitate the merchant and your soldiers charge the carriage to examine it. You open it, revealing a dozen armed men, many of whom are still putting on mail and helmets. Caught unaware, the group are hacked apart by your guards bathing the carriage interior in blood and gore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR18;What do we have here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR18TT;You examine the bloodied contents of the carriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR19;You awaken to the sight of several hanged men dangling in front of you, your wounds being tended to by one of your companions. You brush him aside and rush over to the carriage. After all you know how easy it is for goods to 'go missing' around soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR19;Let's see what the haul is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR19TT;You open the carriage doors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR20;As you walk through the forum all you can hear are the harsh voices of foreigners. Virtueless Vandals. Snivelling Sarmatians. Hibernian Harlots. Whatever happened to the good old days?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR20;Rome for Romans that's what I say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR20;Maybe these changes are for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR20;I expect it's always been this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR21;You wistfully remember the day an old friend left you forever, recalled like so many others to Italia to protect it against those who would do her harm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR21;Britannia and I have to move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR21;Maybe one day we will be able to drink together again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR21;I would give anything to see you once last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR21TT;You feel a void within you that needs expression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR22;Sick of moping about over a lost lover, you feel the need to engage in some good old fashioned artistic expression. Using the old Greek poets of the Aegean as your guide you begin to craft an outpouring of love like no other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR22;I think I am ready for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR22TT;You set stylus to tabula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR22;Well I'll give it a try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR22A;I'll follow Alcaeus and become the greatest poet of Britannia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR22B;I'll follow Sappho and become the greatest poet of Britannia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR23;Against all the odds your works have become a minor success among what little remains of the intelligentsia of the west. Aristocrats across the land have been filling their libraries with your work irrespective of ruler or creed, moved en-masse by your portrayal of solitude on the world's edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR23;That's fantastic news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR23;It's not so surprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR24;Whether due to the general state of learning or the intimate subtlety of your prose, the remaining intelligentsia that live in the western provinces failed to appreciate your work. All your many scrolls are good for now is privy use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR24;I'm not upset about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR24;Those fools wouldn't know great art if it hit them in the skull.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR25;You daydream about living in the Greek speaking east, going to the gymnasion, listening to public displays of poetry. This hellish cultural wasteland will be your undoing. You upturn your recliner and scatter the items on it across the room in frustration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR25;I must find more eastern texts to read!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR25;How I wish I could be Greek...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR25TT;You begin to think of the possibilities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR25;This language is absolutely useless!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR25TT;You begin to feel this might not be for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR26;Eager to sample the higher culture of the Eastern Empire, you contemplate expressing yourself as a full Greek. The civilisation that allowed so many great men to flourish. Herodotus, Alcibiades, Aristotle, Alexander. Surely there would be no great harm in embracing it?
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR26;Barbaros no longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR26TT;You wonder where you can buy beard combs from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR26;Let's not be hasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR26TT;You remember that you hate kykeon gruel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR27A;You contemplate the restoration of the Senate in the west. Surely it represents renewed vigor in the empire? It fills you with pride knowing that once more the world will be subject to Roman rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR27B;At a gathering of friends the topic of the restoration of the Roman Senate comes up. Most of them seem unconcerned, believing that it does not herald any meaningful resurgence in the power of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR27C;Drinking heavily at a feast, the topic inevitably turns to politics. The issue of the restoration of the old senate in Rome comes up. The atmosphere quickly sours and passionate rows soon break out throughout the hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR27;With such wise counsel what could go wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR27;I suppose we'll have to wait and see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR27;We'll give those Romans a bloody good drubbing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR27;I'll make those old men till my crops 'till their backs break!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR28;"What tool do you worthless maggots think a true Roman soldier relies on most?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR28;The scutum shield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR28;The spatha sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR28;The plumbata darts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR28;The caligae sandals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR29;You are brutally flogged yet again by your training master for improperly performing your drills. Rage builds in your heart as the blows rain down on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR29;No slave has the right to hit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR29TT;You plunge your pugio dagger towards the slave's heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR29;I'll just have to improve then magister!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR29TT;You don't think a slave is worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR29;Why sir, why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR29TT;You run away in tears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR30;You're starting to find all this killing and stabbing a bit tiresome. You would rather read a poem by one of the greats instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR30;I'll sneak away and read!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR30TT;You let your brightness shine through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR30;Although I do like the battles...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR31;Taking advantage of a quiet isolated period at the villa, you are overcome by lewd thoughts that you have often repressed before. You subsequently take advantage of one of the slave girls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR31;I hope she enjoyed it too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR31;Now I'm a man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR31;And she won't be the last barbarian either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR31;Was that seriously it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR32A;Your day learning from the magister is going too slowly. All the names and dates of famous peoples and rulers are flying straight over your head. "[Root.GetFirstName]! Which group of barbarians were responsible for sacking Rome!?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR32B;Your day learning from the magister is going too slowly. All the names and dates of famous peoples and rulers are flying straight over your head. "[Root.GetFirstName]! What tribe destroyed the army of Valens at Hadrianopolis?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR32C;Your day learning from the magister is going too slowly. All the names and dates of famous peoples and rulers are flying straight over your head. "[Root.GetFirstName]! What was the name of the tribe that sacked Athens in the reign of Gallienus?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR32;Uh... the Getae?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR32;Uh... the Persians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR32;Uh... the Teutons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR32;The real question is when were you dropped on your head, at birth or later on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR33;Though the forum has certainly seen better days, with disused marble wrecks and meadow taking up large parts of it, market day is still always fairly enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR33;I love civilisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR33;None of this will last, good things never do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR33;I don't think I'm feeling up to this today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR33;I bet I could rack up a massive body count here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR34;Reports have reached your ears of ill-discipline among some of the troops garrisoning for winter. Eager to put the rumors to rest, you order a personal inspection in the freezing snows. Moving down the lines of soldiers you are not impressed at the state of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR34;Absolutely shameful. You're not fit to be Romans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR34;Get your act together or I'll bring back decimation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR34;Good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR35A;While taking dinner you are informed of a recent event that took place on the coast. An angry mule kicked over a container of priceless garum sauce that in turn felled thirty more leading to the ruining of a local notable and the harbor stinking for days after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR35B;Inspecting the walls of the castrum, you see inscribed into it the words "Gaius and Aulus were here" with a crudely drawn phallus next to them. Though surrounded by all of your guards and retainers, you cannot help but laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR35C;While going through the forum you suddenly feel inclined to watch some of the performers. Eventually you settle on a group of rowdy Aegyptians, far from home. Unsurprisingly they are forming an excellent human pyramid. When one of them notices you their excited gesticulations causes the pyramid to suddenly and violently collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR35D;A local tale circulating among your coloni and slaves has managed to reach your ears. Apparently a group of barbarian vagrants broke into a church in  [Root.Capital.GetName] and dragged a heavy sarcophagus half a mile before realising that it was not full of gold, but merely the heavy amphorae of a deceased freedman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR35;That's pretty funny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR36A;After your army's glorious victory over your foes, your soldiers have gathered on the field to perform a formal acclamation. Battering their weapons against their shields, they cry "Hail, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Hail to the glorious [Root.GetTitledFirstName], beloved of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR36B;Your forces have triumphed, and as a result your soldiers have decided to grant you an impromptu form of ovatio. Battering their weapons against their shields, they cry "Glory to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Glory to [Root.GetTitledFirstName] the hammer of the of [Root.Liege.GetRulerTitle], [Root.Liege.GetDynName] and beloved of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR36C;Your forces have triumphed, and as a result your soldiers have decided to perform a ceremony of acclamation for you. Battering their weapons against their shields, they cry "Glory to the noble [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Hail to [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the restorer of the word and beloved of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCROMANFLAVOR36D;Your forces have triumphed, and as a result your soldiers have decided to show their affection for their general. Battering their weapons against their shields, they cry "This victory belongs to you [Root.GetTitledFirstName], beloved of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAROMANFLAVOR36;Your [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] will reward his milites fideli handsomely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBROMANFLAVOR36;A glorious victory to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCROMANFLAVOR36;This victory belongs to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDROMANFLAVOR36;More victories await us under my leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
