EVTDESC451;Young [From.GetTitledFirstName] has caught my attention again. I am starting to think she might fancy me. Her looks and advances get more obvious every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA451;Tonight, I shall have her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB451;It's not appropriate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC451;I do not desire her. She would better stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC453;After sunset I went to Lady [From.GetFirstName]'s chamber. We spent the whole night together in pleasure and passion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA453;It is good to be the [This.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC500;[New.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetTitledFirstName] have gotten married. Traditions allow us to impose a tribute on the local population to pay for the ceremonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA500;Yes, traditions are important, and it is everyone's concern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB500;It is not necessary, we can afford this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1010;Today a dangerous situation arose, and quickly became intimidating, with an outcome that could mean life or death. I swallowed hard and chose to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1010;Run! And live to fight another day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1010;Stay! Never surrender so easily...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1011;It started as an uneasiness around guests and strangers, then evolved into awkwardness and a strong feeling of discomfort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1011;I really prefer to spend my time alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1011;I will have to try and be more friendly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1012;I could strive to become better, but most of the times I could also be satisfied with who I am and what I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1012;No, I will never be satisfied. I want more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1012;Honestly I am quite content with the current state of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1013;If my opinion ruled, the world would be a more chaotic but fun place. If I keep following the laws, the world would have less chaos but also be less fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1013;Let my rule begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1013;Justice should always prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1014;In the darkest moments I find myself wondering... why is the world filled with such hardships, grief and pain? Is there a higher plan? Or is it just chaos?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1014C;God has a plan for everything and everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1014P;The Gods have a plan. They always do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1014C;There is no higher justice in this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1014P;If the Gods are there, they do not care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3305;Everyone else ran off to chase the alleged thieves who had stolen a valuable golden torque from our hall. Instead of following them, I went to the hall and discovered the torque hidden behind one of the benches...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3305;Am I the only smart person in here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME3360;Ancient Burial Grounds;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3360;While I was riding in the woods with my men, we spotted the entrance to an ancient underground burial site. Before I could say anything, some of the warriors rushed inside and started lifting the heavy tombstones. The smell was unbearable, but they persisted until they discovered a collection of dusty but valuable artifacts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3360;We need it more than the dead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3306;[This.GetTitledFirstName] appreciates [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s cowardice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3306;I have had times when the cowardice of [From.GetTitledFirstName] made me doubt [From.GetHerHim]. But the way [From.GetSheHe] handled the situation when everybody else ran in different directions to try and catch a thief made me reevaluate [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3306;The lady had just misplaced the torque;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3307;If no one else tells [This.GetTitledFirstName] [This.GetSheHe] did good, I will;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3307;I had not really expected anyone to truly care about the missing torque, at the time it seemed more like an excuse to make as much noise and tumult as possible. I was proven wrong when [From.GetTitledFirstName] shook my hand and thanked me for finding the torque.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3307;Well... ehum... it was nothing, really!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3325;I was one of the first to saddle my horse and chase after the bandits who had stolen a valuable golden torque from one of our ladies. When I returned, exhausted and with filthy clothes, I was told the young lady had simply misplaced the torque.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3325;She appreciated my effort, at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3330;While riding alone in the woods, I came upon a band of rogues who robbed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3330;They were too many...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3435;Word stood against word, the farmer's against a shepherd's about damage caused to the farmer's crops by the flock of sheep owned by the shepherd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3435;The farmer is obviously lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP3436;[This.GetTitledFirstName] reacts to [Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3435;The farmer should be compensated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4000;A local farmer from [Root.Location.GetName] arrived at the castle this morning. He claims that while working in the fields his neighbor's ox has stroke and injured his own ox to death. The farmer demands for a just compensation according to the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4000;A fair request. The neighbor shall pay for the ox.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4000;Sell the live ox and divide its proceeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4000;I will have the dead animal for a feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4000;Do not bother me with such trivial matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4000;I had a terrible day. Throw this dog out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4010;A group of thieves and raiders has been captured in the woods of [Root.Location.GetName] and brought before me. The long list of all their crimes does not put them in good light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4010;I don't care about these petty thieves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4010;They will have what they deserve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4010;Cut their throats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4010;I will make them suffer before they die...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4010;With some more effort our land could be free from such thugs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4020;A pack of poachers has been spotted in the woods of [Root.Location.GetName]. The local laws reserve the rights of hunting to the ruling class and their servants. I should probably send [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledName] and [Root.job_spymaster.GetTitledName] to investigate the matter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4020;No, I need them for more important things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4020;Go. These poachers must be stopped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4022;I will deal with them myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4022;The law demands their death by hanging!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4022;They must be starving... release them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4022;Kill them and mount their tarred heads above the gates!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4022;Cut off their ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4035;During the past few weeks, sheep have mysteriously disappeared from herds all throughout my land. Luckily, my marshal has managed to discover and arrest the rustlers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4035;The sheep have been returned to the shepherds, no sanction is needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4035;Thievery is punished by cutting off the hands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4035;Another day, I would have spared their lives. Not today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4035;The coldest, darkest cell is reserved for these thieves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4050;Rumors about a foreign spy sneaking around in my own manor were confirmed this morning, when my personal guards caught him red-handed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4050;I shall be merciful... release him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4050;Hang him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4050;Throw him into the dungeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4050;I will kill him with my bare hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4050;Carve out his eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4060;The falconer is expecting me outside the gates, as a new hunting bird has arrived and awaits my inspection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4060;Not now. Tell him I am busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4060;Excellent! Let us see this falcon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4060;A mangy old bird like the last one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4085;The territory of the wolves has crept closer to our holdings in [Root.Location.GetName] and more sheep, pigs and chickens vanish each day. The local farmers are complaining, and they might not be able to fully pay their taxes until this threat is repealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4085;They will pay what is due. The wolves are not to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4085;Every farm and manor shall send a man and fight them together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4085;Give me my sword, I'll deal with these dogs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4085;Arrange a great wolf hunt for tomorrow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4111;My friend [From.GetFirstName] has invited me to a great feast in his hall in [From.Location.GetName]. The ale will flow, and the nobles will sing and dance and feast until the day's end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4111;Why bother? I will surely not go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4111;I will reluctantly attend...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4111;Food, wine and tales... can I ask for more? Saddle the horses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4112;It wasn't until several weeks after the feast I heard about it and wondered why I was not invited. Aren't [From.GetTitledFirstName] and I friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4112;Maybe [From.GetSheHe] just forgot?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4112;How dare [From.GetSheHe]? Not anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4112;Dear [From.GetTitledFirstName], we need to talk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4115;A travelling caravan of merchants selling all sorts of food, clothing, spices and luxuries, has arrived in [Root.Location.GetName] and filled the town square with their stalls, wares and shouts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4115;Good. They must surely have something I need...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4115;These peddlers will not have my coins...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4115;They never have anything in my size!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4115;I don't like the merchants, but their wares are fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4115;Very good! I like to watch people bartering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF4115;Fairs should be banned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4125;The week before the great fighting event in the arena was a stressful one. Stands for the spectators had to be erected, the warriors who arrived needed housing and my chain mail had to be refitted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4125;We shall make sure that all due taxes are collected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4125;This is what I have been waiting for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4125;A great event! Let the fighting begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4125;Have the priests hold a solemn opening ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4125;The mead will flow afterwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4150;A man claiming to be a lord who disappeared seven years ago has found his way to our castle. He sings of ancient artifacts and distant lands, and some say his songs are prophetic...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4150;Long lost, but home again. Welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4150;Why should I believe him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4150;Just an old drunk. Throw him out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4150;I have no reason to believe him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4150;He's finally found his way home then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF4150;I'd love to hear him sing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3124150;A foreign traveller claiming to arrive from distant lands in the south has found his way to our castle. He is offering his loyal services to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and demanding only hospitality and protection in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3124150;He can surely be of some use. Welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3124150;I do not trust this man. Send him away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC3124150;A spy sent by our enemies! Kill him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD3124150;He is a pagan. He is not welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE3124150;He is a Christian. He is not welcome here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC4155;A travelling bard and his wife arrived this morning from the forest of Broceliande. They play harps, lutes and wooden flutes, and their performances range from vulgar to epic, including family histories, eulogies of great lords and their deeds, sharp political satires and even slow romantic ballads...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA4155;Romantic ballads? Please, save me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB4155;They will not dare write any satires about me! I'll have their heads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC4155;Great! There is much to be learned from these travellers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD4155;I hope they know the ballad 'Gwydion and Aranrhod'!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE4155;I remember those two, they came here last year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF4155;They will be paid well, I assure you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC5034;A prestigious fighting event will take place in a province not far from here. The local lords will gather and fight to the first blood for honor and gold. This could be my chance to make my special lady fall in love with me. I have to win so she will love me forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37001;Today, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] asked me for a fief of [From.GetPossPronoun] own to govern...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA37001;I promised to arrange it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB37001;I told [From.GetFirstName] [From.GetSubjectPronoun] could become a priest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC37001;I told [From.GetObjectPronoun] [From.GetSubjectPronoun] is not ready...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37051;My beloved [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is concerned that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] is still not married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA37051;I will find [From.GetObjectPronoun] someone suitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP37052;[This.GetSubjectPronounCap] is delighted with my promise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB37051;I have different plans for [From.GetObjectPronoun], at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP37053;[This.GetSubjectPronounCap] storms out of the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37052;My [GetFromRelation] has promised to arrange a marriage for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37055;[From.GetFirstName], my dear [GetFromRelation], clearly upset, is reminding me of my promise to get [From.GetObjectPronoun] married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA37055;I have just the person in mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB37055;Enough. The priests will take care of [From.GetObjectPronoun].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC37055;I still have not found someone suitable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC64030;Tomorrow I will finally have a chance to spend some time with my lover.\nThere are so many things we could do...\nShould I try to entertain [Root.GetHerHimOpp] at the court, or maybe we should spend some time alone in the woods?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA64030;I shall take [Root.GetHerHimOpp] into the woods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB64030;I will arrange a feast at the local court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC64030;I do have other plans for tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC69003;A childless courtier with a strange choice of lifestyle has shown men a bit more attention than the women at court. Might it be that he is a sodomite?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA69003;I will confront him and ask him if this is true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP69004;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is accused of sodomy by [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB69003;It is my duty to inform everyone about this suspected sodomite!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC69003;I have no interest in what he does in his bed. Let him be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC73000;A famous writer arrived to our court this morning. He apparently desires to compose a family chronicle of the House [From.GetOnlyDynastyName], and asks only for a few gold pieces in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA73000;An excellent idea. We shall give him patronage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB73000;There is nothing to write about. Ignore him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC73001;My young wife has taken a passion for romantic poetry. She keeps reading any sort of romantic poetry she can get hold of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA73001;Good. Get her more to read...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB73001;Well, that is her interest. Not mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC73001;No more! These books are the work of Satan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC73003;Peasants from the fields and rural settlements of [Root.Location.GetName] have sent a representative to petition for our support for one of their traditional festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA73003;Traditions are important. We can afford it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB73003;They are just peasants...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC73004;A young talented bard from [Root.Location.GetName] proposes to compose an epic poem about the great life of [Root.Father.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA73004;Excellent. He will be a guest in our halls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB73004;There is nothing worth singing about my father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC73006;A trusted advisor just brought to my attention that one of the serving maids have given birth to a child. According to him, my son is the father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA73006;That is my lad! Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB73006;He will have to adopt the child now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC73006;Did he really sleep with a filthy servant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD73006;Send him to confess his sins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC73007;My beloved wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] is constantly bored and keeps talking about some new oriental customs she has heard about. Now she wants me to introduce them at court...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA73007;Whatever you ask for, my love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB73007;We should rather spend our time praying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC73007;I regret we can not afford any luxuries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74025;I'd prefer if you performed 'The Chant of the Winter King'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74025;Theatre is a reflection of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC74025;Leave as soon as you are done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD74025;[Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] wants you to join us for a banquet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC74030;Even if the local priests frowns upon jugglers and actors, I enjoy their humorous and bawdy acts during the Summer Fair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA74030;One of them can juggle nine apples at the same time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB74030;Priests usually do not like fun things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC74030;If the priest says anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD74030;If the priests do not like it, should I really like it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC77000;In the province of [Root.GetName], small traders and merchants selling fresh fish straight from the river, fruits and vegetables, usually set up their stalls in front of the churches, where they can meet most people.\n\nThe clergy, however, is not fond about the traders and their tumultuous activities, and demands that any trade shall be forbidden in the church squares.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA77000;I agree. Forbid it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB77000;They do no harm, let them stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC77001;In a recent dispute, the citizens of [Root.GetName] have claimed the superiority of civil laws over canonical laws, but the local bishops have protested, declaring that the law of the Holy Church should supersede the law of the town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA77001;I agree with them. Civil laws are superior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB77001;The laws should be equal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC77002;An ancient traditional custom from the old north, almost forgotten by all but the feudal lords, called 'Prima Noctae' or 'Ius Primae Noctis', is the subject of a heated debate. The feudal lords in [Root.GetName] claim that it is their right to take the virginity of their serfs' maiden daughters on the day of their wedding, and the serfs are protesting against it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA77002;Ancient traditions shall be respected! Let the lords have some fun...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB77002;This is an absurd request! I forbid it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC77003;They come from smaller farms, some with a goat or a pig to sell, some with only a bushel of vegetables or fruits, others with a whole wagon of produce. The peasants of [Root.GetName] sell their produce inside the town walls, but the rich merchants of the town protest against it and want to forbid it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA77003;These farmers always cause trouble. Don't let them in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB77003;Everyone should be able to sell their produce inside the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC77004;Apparently, the forests of [Root.GetName] are not big enough for the feudal lords. After chasing a stag to the edge of the Church land, they had to stop the hunt to avoid the anger of the priests. They now demand hunting rights on the lands belonging to the Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA77004;It's not a big deal. Let them hunt on the Church land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB77004;Stay on your side of the forest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30052;My wife [Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] was captivated by the grace and strength of the hunting birds and became a falconer. Today [Root.Spouse.GetSheHe] is begging me to provide [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] with a new bird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA30052;An old buzzard will have to suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB30052;I will bring [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] the best falcon in [Root.Location.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC30052;Too dangerous my love, I don't want you to overexert yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC319700;The sheep and lambs sent to market this year have sold very well. A seemingly increased demand for their uncured wool, their meat and their skins has led to an increase of their usually low value. The addition of a tithe upon the extra income of the farmers would see our coffers receive a welcome boost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319700;No tithe is necessary. Let the farmers keep what they earned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB319700;A small tithe will be sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC319700;We shall apply a moderate tithe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD319700;I will have their additional profit as my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC319701;The amount of gold accrued from the sale of sheep and lambs has been pretty dire during the past few months.\nApparently, much of this year's 'breed' has been frail, weak and feable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319701;Am I lacking a steward's mind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB319701;We must act to see the herds of the realm properly bred and reared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC319701;I have no interest in sheep or pigs! Spare me from such duties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC319702;All of the cattle destined for market this year has sold very well. The demand has been high for their meat, guts and skin.\nThe minor lords and serfs have earned so well, that a tithe applied unto them could be argued as just.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319702;No tithe is necessary. Let them keep what they earned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB319702;I can easily justify a small tithe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC319702;They will have to accept a moderate tithe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD319702;I will have their additional profit as my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC319703;The farmers have given word that most of their cattle seem to be ill, frail and very weak. The sale of meat has been pretty dire during the past few months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319703;Poor animals. There is nothing I can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB319703;Give orders to quarantine all the cattle showing signs of disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC319703;I have no interest in farmers or cattle! Spare me from such duties!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC319704;A strong and virile bull has gained a reputation within the realm as a prime breeder of large and strong cattle stock.\nSuch an animal is a very important asset to any serf who oversees cattle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319704;Excellent! Have him bred throughout the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB319704;We shall sell the beast for good profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC319704;A fine bull, I must have him for a feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD319704;I have no interest in farmers or cattle! Spare me from such topics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME319710;Storm Brewing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC319710;Today a strong wind has been growing, and now a gathering of dark and rumbling clouds is hovering over the realm. A raging storm is surely ahead. Hopefully, it will pass over our land and unleash its wrath upon others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319710;May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] protect us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB319710;Probably nothing to be worried about. We will be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC319711;The rain came hard and fast, constantly beating into the ground for days. There had not been torrential rain like it for years. At first the ground was able to take it, but now much of the land is severely flooded and even landslides are occuring at higher ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319711;Our castle stands firm. The peasants deserve the wrath of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP319711A;Much of the land within §Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s§W demesne falls victim to the torrential rainfall.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB319711;I shall instruct our [Root.GetTreasurerName] to assist the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP319711B;Though much of §Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s§W land has been damaged by the flooding, the effects are greatly lessened due to the investments made.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC319711;The land and the people are in danger. I must act now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP319711C;§Y[Root.GetTitledFirstName]'s§W diligence ensures that the flooded areas and the local farmers recover quickly.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC319712;The storm that was brewing brought the wrath of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] upon us. The rain was vicious but the wind even more so. Never had winds been felt like it, many thatched roofs were ripped from buildings and weaker structures fell from the great force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319712;Unfortunately, repairing our quarters is going to be costly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC319713;Thankfully, the storm that was brewing above our lands did not come to strength. The clouds seemed to part and the sun broke through as if [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] himself had willed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319713;It is such a beautiful day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA319714;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] truly listens to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
