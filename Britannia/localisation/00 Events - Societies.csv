EVTDESC302000;News has reached you of a new monastic movement spreading through the Christian lands of Western Europe. Founded by the monk Benedict of Nursia from his monastaries of Sublaqueum and Casinum, monks living under these orders practice a less strict balance between individual piety and more practical work or charity than under many other rules. Monks and missionaries are now rapidly spreading the Rule of Saint Benedict through the monastaries of Italy and Gaul, where monks live, pray, and work under his precepts of devotion, humility, and love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
