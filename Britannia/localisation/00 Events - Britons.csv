EVTNAME3121000;Return to Dumnonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3121000;Your father, the great Uther Pendragon, King of Dumnonia, has died, leaving your clubfooted infant nephew Mordred as King of Dumnonia. Following on the oaths made in your name, you have returned to Dumnonia to protect the kingdom and your nephew's inheritance from those who would sunder the realm apart. Eagerly received by those who see you as their saviour in this time of strife and uncertainty, you have been appointed Lord of Durnac by the current regent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3121000;Dumnonia shall not fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312100;Death of King Uther Pendragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312100;Uther Pendragon, King of Dumnonia, is dead. The only legitimate heir to the throne, Mordred, is a clubfooted child. Upon receiving news of his father's death, Uther's bastard son, Arthur, has returned from the kingdom of Benoic and has been appointed Lord of Durnac by the current regent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312100;Hail to King Mordred and Lord Arthur!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312100;Let us hope Arthur will drive the Saxons back to the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC312100;We will conquer their lands, no matter who is leading them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD312100;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312101;Arthur Returns to Dumnonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312101;Upon receiving news of his father's death, King Uther's bastard son, Arthur, has returned to Dumnonia from the kingdom of Benoic, where he was sent by Uther to assist King Ban in his wars against the Franks. Upon arrival, Arthur has been appointed Lord of Durnac by your current regent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312101;A loyal vassal... or is he plotting for my throne?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312103;With a child on the throne and enemies surrounding it on all sides, Dumnonia has never been in a greater need of a strong ruler. While most people have faith in your ability to administer the kingdom in Mordred's place, many are looking at Arthur, Uther's bastard son, as Dumnonia's only hope in these troubled times. Perhaps it would be better to leave the regency to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312103_1;With a child on the throne and enemies surrounding it on all sides, Dumnonia has never been in a greater need of a strong ruler. While most people have faith in your ability to administer the kingdom in Mordred's place, many felt that Arthur was a great leader and that he should continue to hold power in the realm. Perhaps it would be better to leave the regency to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTPOTA312103;Arthur would be a much better ruler than I ever could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTPOTB312103;We have no need for Arthur. I will stave off the Saxons myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312104;Recognizing your military prowess and ability to unite the kingdom against the Saxons, [From.GetTitledName] has offered to make you regent of Dumnonia. While Mordred is still technically the king, many hope that you will be able to lead the kingdom against its many enemies and restore its strength and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312104_1;Recognizing your military prowess and ability to unite the kingdom against the Saxons, [From.GetTitledName] has offered to make you regent of Dumnonia once more. While Mordred is still technically the king, many hope that you will be able once again to lead the kingdom against its many enemies and restore its strength and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTPOTA312104;It is for the good of the kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312105;Your current regent has stepped aside to allow Arthur to become regent of Dumnonia. Known as a great warrior from his campaigns against the Franks and Saxons, Arthur could be key to holding off the Saxons to the east, yet as the son of Uther he has a claim to the throne, and many think that Arthur, not you, should be the king...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312105_1;Your current regent has stepped aside to allow Arthur to become regent of Dumnonia once more. Many see him as the realm's saviour and Arthur could indeed be key to holding off the Saxons to the east, yet his claim to the throne could still be problematic...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTPOTA312105;A great warrior, perhaps, but is he plotting for my throne?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312106;The current regent of Dumnonia has stepped aside to allow Arthur to gain control of Dumnonia. Known as a great warrior from his campaigns against the Franks and Saxons, Arthur could be key to holding off the Saxons to the east that seek to conquer our lands. As the son of Uther, he has a claim to the throne, yet he seems to show no ambition to take it from Mordred...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME3121070;The Wolftails;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3121070;Under the guidance of Merlin and the training of Hywel, Derfel Cadarn has grown to be quite a capable warrior. Honest and loyal, he is devoted to your cause and would make a great general in the fight against [Root.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s enemies. If we make him a lord of his own band of warriors he could be a useful vassal and ally against the Saxons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3121070;I will grant him a band of warriors as his own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB3121070;He does not deserve such an honour yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME3121071;The Wolftails;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3121071;Impressed by your skills as a warrior, [From.GetTitledName] has decided to grant you a band of warriors to call your own. Using the tails of wolves attached to your helmets as an emblem, you have decided to name your new band "The Wolftails", one that will in time surely strike fear into the hearts of Anglo-Saxons everywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3121071;I will serve Arthur loyally and well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME3121072;The Wolftails;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3121072;Your uncle and regent, [From.GetTitledName], has decided to grant the young but skilled Derfel Cadarn his own band of warriors and make him a lord.

EVTOPTA3121072;A band of noble warriors... or a tool for Arthur to gain my throne?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312108;[d_wolftails.Holder.GetTitledName] has declared that the oaths of fealty [d_wolftails.Holder.GetSheHe] and [d_wolftails.Holder.GetHerHis] warriors once swore have expired, and that the Wolftails will no longer owe fealty to the Kings of Dumnonia. From this day on the Wolftails will be a free company, ready to fight for any British kingdom that will hire them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312108;A sad day for [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312110;The Rise of Arthur;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312110;After the death of his father Uther, your friend and patron Arthur returned to Dumnonia to become regent for his young nephew Mordred.

EVTNAME3121101;The Brotherhood Horsemen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3121101;Sagramor, the famed Numidian warrior and your close friend during your campaigns in Armorica, has come to [Root.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] with his powerful band of horsemen.

EVTOPTA3121102;A band of noble warriors... or a plot of Arthur to gain my throne?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC3121103;[d_brotherhood_horsemen.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] has announced that the Brotherhood Horsemen's time in service to Dumnonia has come to and end, and that [d_brotherhood_horsemen.Holder.GetHerHis] company of warriors will now return to their old status adventuring around the island. From this day on the Brotherhood Horsemen will be a free company, ready to fight for any British kingdom that will hire them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA3121103;Dumnonia owes them much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312112;Arthur, the Imperator;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312112;A wave of cheers and shouts ring through the crowds of [Root.Location.GetName] as your vassals acclaim you as the true ruler of Dumnonia. Though you shun the title of King that your father and nephew once held, your vassals still quietly call you one, and your closest entourage see fit to view you as Imperator of southern Britain, a worthy successor to the glory of Romans before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312112;There are some who still view Mordred as King, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME312115;The Decline of Dumnonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312115_uther_death;King Uther of Dumnonia has died, bringing his long and prosperous reign to a close.

EVTOPTC312118;The age of the Britons is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD312118;This is interesting news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312130;As regent, most of Dumnonia supports you, but not all. The right marriage will shore up your position at court, and especially among the other kings who still eye Dumnonia for themselves. Princess Ceinwyn, the Star of Powys, is the logical choice, cementing an alliance with Gorfyddyd, the powerful King of Powys. But Princess Guinevere of the lost kingdom, Henis Wyren, radiates an aura of destiny. She will marry a great man, and thinks you are one, despite your bastardry. Will you put the interests of Dumnonia aside, for a woman who sets your heart aflame?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312130;I love the brilliant, bewitching Guinevere. She must be my bride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312130;I can suffer the beautiful and kind Ceinwyn, for Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312130_TOOLTIP;§Y[This.GetTitledName]§! and §Y[Root.Liege.GetTitledName]§! sign a non-aggression pact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312131;In a surprising move, the famed warrior Arthur, [Root.GetArthurTitle], has announced his marriage to your courtier Guinevere, daughter of the dispossessed King Leodegan of Henis Wyren. Apparently, he spurned many other more wealthy and connected princesses for this choice, so great was his his love and yearning for Guinevere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312131_1;The great Arthur might be unparalleled among men, but he has never faced a woman like yourself versed in the ways of romance and seduction. Indeed, a smile here, a wink there, and now Arthur is practically begging you to marry him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312131;My blessings to the newlyweds, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312131_1;I see greatness in Arthur. We will share it together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312131;He lacks in ambition. I can do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312132;You have tried everything you can think of, made every tearful plea your mouth will produce, but still the beautiful Guinevere resolutely refuses to take your hand in marriage. It seems that despite all she has done to attract your attention and pull at your heart, she has simply lost interest in you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312132;But... but why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312133;You were shocked when Ceinwyn ran off and disappeared at her wedding - you had always known that she was stubborn, but not that she was capable of something like this! Now, you have heard that she has eloped with Derfel Cadarn, one of Arthur's soldiers in Dumnonia, pledging to never formally marry but to live with him as husband and wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312133_1;From the moment you first saw Derfel Cadarn you knew you two were meant to be together. Your father may have had other plans for you, but no matter - all it took was a bit of running off to elope with your love. A princess can't exactly marry a lowly soldier, but that doesn't mean you can't still spend the rest of your life with him...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312133;Well, that was a surprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312133_1;We will be together for all time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312133_2;She did what?!? How could my Ceinwyn do this?!?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312134;You always did know that your courtier Derfel was in love with Ceinwyn, the Princess of Powys, but never did you think anything would come of it. So you were very surprised when she suddenly appeared in your court without warning with Derfel, and even more so when word got to you they had apparently pledged to spend the rest of their lives together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312134_1;You were in love the moment you laid your eyes on her, but you knew that a lowly soldier like you never had a chance with the brilliant Ceinwyn, the Star of Powys. Yet you never gave up hope, and apparently Ceinwyn thought the same... and now she has run off to elope with you, pledging to be at your side forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312134;A fine catch, Derfel. I am impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312134_1;You... you really did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312136;A diplomat from Arthur, [Root.GetArthurTitle] and hero of the Britons, has arrived in your court asking for the hand in marriage of your [GetFromRelation] Ceinwyn, Princess of Powys. He offers an alliance between the two leading kingdoms of Britannia to fight against the Saxons together, and promises to treat her with the utmost love and respect deserving of a princess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312136_1;A diplomat from Arthur, [Root.GetArthurTitle] and hero of the Britons, has arrived in your court asking for your hand in marriage, wishing to cement an alliance between Powys and Dumnonia against the Saxons. While he isn't quite the man that you truly love in your heart, his honour and integrity is second to none and you know that he can truly be trusted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312136;A worthy husband for my Star.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312136_TOOLTIP;§Y[This.GetTitledName]§! and §Y[Root.GetTitledName]§! sign a non-aggression pact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312136_1;I suppose I could do much worse than Arthur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB312136;No. He's just not the right man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312137;Your regent, Arthur, has announced his marriage to Ceinwyn, the Princess of Powys, sealing an alliance between Dumnonia and [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Arthur and [From.GetTitledFirstName] have expressed their hope that this new alliance between the two former rivals will enable the Britons to form a united front against the Saxons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312137;But is the alliance with me, or with Arthur?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312137_TOOLTIP;§Y[From.GetTitledName]§! and §Y[Root.GetTitledName]§! sign a non-aggression pact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312138;You were somewhat surprised to receive a polite, but firm, statement from [From.GetBestName] refusing your offer of a marriage alliance. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has 'other plans'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312138;A pity. It would have brought peace to Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312139;During a visit to your court, Lancelot, [Root.GetLancelotStatus], seems to have been quickly enamoured with your courtier Guinevere, daughter of the dispossessed King Leodegan of Henis Wyren. Somewhat to your surprise, the proud and haughty princess seems to have been quite receptive, and after spending a number of days courting each other the two have announced their marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312139_1;You were somewhat disappointed when Arthur married Ceinwyn - despite clearly having shown interest in you - but that all disappeared when you met Lancelot, [Root.GetLancelotStatus]. He may not quite be Arthur's equal and his claims of greateness are slightly suspect, but his ambition and haughty disposition definitely makes up for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312139;Good for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312139_1;Together, we will rule Britannia...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312173;You didn't really think he would ever find a woman he deemed worthy enough to marry him, but while on a visit to the court of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], your [GetFromRelation] Lancelot seems to have fallen in love with Guinevere, daughter of the dispossessed King Leodegan of Henis Wyren. It seems that the feeling was mutual, and now the two have now announced their marriage to each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312173_1;While visiting the court of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], a beautiful woman catches your eye. She introduces herself as Guinevere, princess of Henis Wyren, and smiles at you, saying that she has been waiting a long time for a man as great and ambitious as you. She emits an aura of beauty, passion, and ambition, and immediately you know you are meant for each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312173;Congratulations, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312173_1;Marry me, Guinevere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312175;Since Arthur's marriage you have noticed that your [GetFromRelation] Derfel being more sullen than usual, seemingly heartbroken. While you're not quite sure why he has become like this, he seems to be consoling himself in the company of his old friend Nimue, and two have become increasingly close over the last few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312175_1;Watching Ceinwyn get married was painful, but you consoled yourself in the knowledge that she would be well cared for in Arthur's hands. As you mourn the loss of your secret love, you find yourself spending more and more time with your old friend Nimue... perhaps she is the one who is truly meant for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312175;Good for him, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312175_1;I do think we should be together more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312176;Recently you have noticed your courtier Nimue spending more and more time in the company of [FromFrom.GetBestName]. While you know that they have been friends since childhood, it seems that the two have become rather close as of late, perhaps more than just friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC312176_1;Recently your friend Derfel has been spending more and more time with you, heartbroken over Ceinwyn's marriage to Arthur. While you have known each other since you were little in Merlin's tower, you and Derfel are no longer children, and as you get close to him you can feel something more stirring within you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312176;Well, good for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA312176_1;Let us be together under the Gods, Derfel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME311187;Married to a Macsen daughter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC311187;My wife is a direct female descendant of the great Imperator, Magnus Maximus, once ruler of all of Britain and Gaul. Through her, I can legitimise my own claim to this land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC302900;To the great and most loyal [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nA province divided against itself will never stand in this dark and dangerous world.

EVTDESC302910;The concept of a High King ruling over all of Britannia is deeply entrenched, but the need for a king to prove himself before even attempting to be recognized has long prevented any sort of continuity from being established.
