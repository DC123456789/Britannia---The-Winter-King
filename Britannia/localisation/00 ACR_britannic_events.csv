britannic.103.b;It's just bad weather!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.105.desc;With [From.GetFirstName] now out of infancy, [From.GetSheHe] is too old to be Thumoideachais. Without Britannia's blessing at the hands of a dryad [From.GetSheHe] will be ostracized and known as Sych, "dry".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

britannic.150.a;Let the festivities commence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

britannic.152.b;Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.153.desc;You're making a visit to the local holy well for the Imbolg. As you wait your turn to make the sunwise walk around it, you decide what offering you will make to the Sanctaidd.\n\nThe traditional, but low-class, clootie cloth or an offering of gold?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.153.a;I will leave a clootie cloth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.153.b;I will leave an offering of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.154.desc;As you wait in line for your turn to leave an offering at the well for the Imbolg, you notice [From.GetTitledFirstName] ahead of you. [From.GetSheHe] ties a clootie to the well's post. While this is an acceptable, even traditional, offering, it's a bit cheap for someone of [From.GetHerHis] station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.154.a;Very frugal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.154.b;Shameful, just shameful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.155.desc;As you wait in line for your turn to leave an offering at the well for the Imbolg, you notice [From.GetTitledFirstName] ahead of you. [From.GetSheHe] tosses a handful of duccats into the well. While not a traditional one, it is a generous offering, suiting someone of [From.GetHerHis] rank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.155.a;Very pious of [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.155.b;A waste of good coin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.156.desc;You've heard rumors that [From.GetFullName] has been speaking well of you. Specifically they've been praising you for your choice of offering at the well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.157.desc;You've heard rumors that [From.GetFullName] has been speaking ill of you. Specifically they're criticising your choice of offering at the well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.158.desc;You find yourself sitting at a table in a city square. All around you people are making solar wheels from blackthorn to hang on their door mantles, to bless their homes for the next year. A child next to you smiles and asks if you're going to make one too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.158.a;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.159.desc;You've been sitting with [the_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] around one of the bonfires for the Imbolg. Before long, you've been talking for hours and having a wonderful time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

britannic.162.tt;You and [From.GetTitledFirstName] are now bitter rivals!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.163.desc;Hundreds of people fill the streets, each with a lit candle in hand. The procession slowly moves down the road as all sing hymns to Saint Brigid and The Holy Mother.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.164.desc;The local dryads have lodged a complaint regarding some fortune tellers that set up shop during the festival. They are offering to divine the number and gender of a couple's children. The dryads say these claims are heresy, as only Britannia knows this. However, the diviners are proving popular with the people.\n\nWhat do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.164.a;Surely, they are doing no harm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.164.b;We cannot allow this blasphemy to continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.165.desc;Word has quickly spread throughout the city, a prominent local merchant has given birth! The dryads are calling this a sign of good favor from The Holy Mother and a bountiful year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.165.a;Britannia smiles on us this day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.165.b;Superstitious nonesense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.166.desc;Word has quickly spread through the city like a dark cloud. A prominent local merchant has had a still born child! The dryads are warning all that it is a sign of Britannia's ire and that a bad year is ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.166.a;May Britannia forgive us for our sins...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.166.b;Superstitious nonesense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.169.desc;As you walk down the street admiring the festivities, you feel a light touch brushing your shoulder. "Be the conduit of Britannia's blessing," a voice whispers. You recognize [From.GetTitledFirstName] as you turn to face her. "I want you," she says, desire in her eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.169.a;You have no idea how long I've waited for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.169.b;I do this for Britannia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.169.c;Get ahold of yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.172.desc;As you walk down the street admiring the festivities, you feel a light touch brushing your shoulder. "Let me be the conduit of Britannia's blessing," a voice whispers. You recognize [From.GetFullName] as you turn to face him. "I want you," he says, desire in his eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.172.a;You have no idea how long I've waited for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.172.b;May Britannia bless me with child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.172.c;You forget your place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.175.desc;You and [From.GetTitledFirstName] are walking down the street, watching the festivities, when [From.GetSheHe] points out a young couple in a moment of passion in a corner of the square. [From.GetName] gives you a suggestive look and smiles, "Shall we continue the festivities somewhere private?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.175.a;You're so bad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.175.b;I don't want to miss any of the festival!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.175.c;I'm sorry my love, I have a headache.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.199.desc;With the merchants packing their wares and the dryads performing their final blessings, the Imbolg has come to a close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
britannic.199.a;I wonder how next year's festival will go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
