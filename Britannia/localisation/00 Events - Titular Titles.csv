EVTNAME314440;High Kingdom of Armorica;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314440;In the far northwest of Gaul, [Root.GetFullName] has managed to unite the principalities of the Armorican pennisula under his rule and conquer vast territories beyond into the heart of what was once known as Armorica. Now, his vassals have recognized his sovereign lordship, no longer a mere king among many, and crowned him High King in the Great Hall of [Root.Location.GetName]. \n\nWhile province after province fell to the barbarian invaders, Armorica stood as a bastion for Romans and Celts alike, successfully resisting every attempt to truly subjugate the pennisula. Will a unified Armorica be strong enough to resist the predations of the Germanic invaders and restore Celtic dominance over Gaul?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314440;Armorica shall prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC314749;After unifying much of Gaul under [Root.GetHerHis] rule, [Root.GetTitledName] has had himself crowned Imperator and declared the restoration of the Empire in the west! The newly restored empire claims authority over all of the former Roman Gaul, and [Root.GetTitledName] has decreed the restoration of the old Roman provinces of the area over the claims of the obsolete Germanic tribal kingdoms.\n\nWhile his claim to the Empire has been decried by many Romans asserting that no barbarian could ever be emperor, few in the realm openly challenge his legitimacy.  Only one question remains - will the new empire be content with what it has achieved, or will these Romanized "barbarian" emperors only stop like the Romans before them when they have "made a desert and call it peace"?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA314749;Long live the restored Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME314780;High Kingdom of Akitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314780;From the mountains of the Pyrenees to the plains of Novempopulania, [Root.GetFullName] has managed to unite all the old Aquitani lands and has pushed beyond into the great Romano-Gallic cities of the Garumna. Now, his vassals have recognized his sovereign lordship and crowned him High King in the Great Hall of [Root.Location.GetName]. \n\nWhile the rest of Gaul adopted the culture of the Romans and the rule of the Germans, only the tribes of the Vasconians kept their language and way of life, resisting all foreign attempts at subjugation. With centuries of tenacity in its blood, will an ascendant Akitania ever be truly defeated?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME314800;High Kingdom of Denmark;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC314800;In the Isles of the Danes and the neighbouring lands, [Root.GetFullName] has managed to defeat his fellow petty kings and unify the land under [Root.GetHerHis] rule, as the great king Dan once did. Now, he has had himself crowned "High Kingdom of Denmark" in the Great Mead Hall of [From.Capital.GetName], claiming authority over all of the three lands of Jutland, Sjaelland, and Skane.\n\nNot to be satisfied with [From.GetHerHis] current domain, [From.GetTitledName] is already planning [From.GetHerHis] future conquests - looking south into Germania, west across the North Sea, and north into the fellow Norse kingdoms. Only time will tell who will be the first to suffer the wrath of the fierce and merciless Danish warriors descending on their realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC314801;Having triumphed over the other petty kings of northern Scandinavia, [Root.GetFullName] has managed to unify the rugged fjords and ripuarian valleys of the Scandes and had himself crowned "High King of Norway" in the Great Mead Hall of [From.Capital.GetName], claiming sovereignty from the coasts of the Skaggerak to Trondelag and beyond.\n\nWhile ambitious Norse lords and kings have always looked eagerly over the North Sea for new lands to plunder and conquer, this new kingdom unites the proud navigators and shipbuilders of the Norwegian coast like never before. Only time will tell where the unified Norwegian kingdom will strike next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC314802;In the snowy forests of Geatland, [Root.GetFullName] has managed to triumph over [Root.GetHerHis] fellow chiefs and unify the many petty kingdoms of the Geats under his rule. Now, his vassals have recognized his sovereign lordship and crowned him High King of all the Geats in the Great Mead Hall of [Root.Location.GetName].\n\nThe fierce name of the Geats and Goths once struck fear into the hearts men across Europe and beyond. Will the newly unified kingdom of the Geats live up to their much-vaunted reputation and usher in a new age of Geatish rule and glory?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC314803;In the distant northeast of Scandinavia, [Root.GetFullName] has managed to subjugate [Root.GetHerHis] rival chieftains and stands unchallenged among the petty kings of the Swedes. Now, his vassals have recognized his sovereign lordship and crowned him High King of all the Swedes in the Great Mead Hall of [Root.Location.GetName].\n\nThe ambitious Swedes now look south into lands of the Geats and east out into the Mare Suebicum and beyond, eagerly searching for new lands to explore, plunder, and conquer. Will the new united Swedish kingdom extend its power throughout Scandinavia and beyond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC314804;Long have the fierce Norse warriors been divided into innumerable petty tribes and kingdoms, with many great kings rising above the fray only to have their realm dismembered upon their deaths. But now, against all odds, [Root.GetFullName] has managed to unite all the four nations under [Root.GetHerHis] rule and in a great ceremony has been crowned "High King of the Norse" in the Great Mead Hall of [Root.Location.GetName].\n\nEven when divided, the Norse were feared throughout the known world for their fierce warriors and legendary seafarers. Does this spell a great new age of Norse supremacy over Europe? Or is this union of Danes, Norwegians, Geats and Swedes fated to fail and collapse, torn between the tensions and rivalries of its constituent nations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC314825;[Root.GetTitledName] has done what many believed to be impossible - against all odds, [Root.GetSheHe] has managed to unite all of the disparate tribes of Magna Germania under his banner, from the marshes of the German Sea to the forests of the Rhenus and Danubius and beyond.\n\nNow titling himself "High King of the Germans", [Root.GetTitledName] has implicitly laid claim to the various Germanic tribes and kingdoms of Scandinavia, Ænglaland, and the former Roman Empire - with the armies of some of the fiercest warriors in the known world to back his words up. Does this herald a new era of Germanic domination across Western Europe? Or will this vast new confederation collapse into tribal infighting once more, unable to hold together the disparate wills of its constituent peoples?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
