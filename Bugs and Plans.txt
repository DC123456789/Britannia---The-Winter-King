Issues
- Christianity spreads a bit fast in Britannia?
- AI doesn't upgrade government form fast enough - building problems?
- AI spends all their prestige on tribal armies/retinues

Current Plans (What you are currently doing and what you plan/want to do for this patch):
- Adjust title/decision gender requirements for religion/culture/laws/game rules
- Reduced culture/religion revolt risk for Sub-Roman and Germanic governments
- Take a look at chronic Frankish instability
- Subjugation/reunification cb between small independent Imperial realms (like pagan subjugation)
- Anglo-Saxon overhaul
	- Add cooldown to general county conquest cb (3 years?) -> need to slow down overall rate of conquest significantly
	- Restrict conquest cb between Anglo-Saxons -> significant realm size + prestige requirement, costs a significant amount of prestige and some gold, large cooldown (5-10 years, to make in nonviable to conquer everyone else with), can't use on small realms
		- Easier to use on non-de jure territory (of the defender) -> represents the competition between Mercia and Wessex for SE England
	- Add cb allowing Anglo-Saxon kings to subjugate small neighbouring Anglo-Saxon realms for a significant prestige/gold cost (allows subjugating small king-level realms as well)
	- Add pagan subjugation-esque cb allowing you to subjugate other Saxons within your de jure Anglo-Saxon kingdom (activates ~530 - 540?)
	- Revolt risk for holding territory in the wrong de jure kingdom
	- In general, add in liberation revolts for if Anglo-Saxon kingdoms get conquered -> possibly event chain where a deposed king or claimant can invade as an adventurer, with their former vassals rising up against you as well (historically there were a few instances of whole kingdoms being annexed, but it was usually reversed soon afterwards)
	- Aenglaland can be claimed by accumulating enough hegemony score, which is gained by a combination of how many provinces you rule over (including tributaries) + number of tributaries + number of king level titles (past 1)
		- Encourage tributarizing all of the realms around you, though tributaries should also try to rebel and regain their independence quite often
		- Also allows for claiming Aengland if you are more or less the only Anglo-Saxon king left, because the others have been conquered (e.g. as historically by the Danes, or if you manage to unite most of England anyway)
		- Will need some ideas for how this works without Horse Lords since they don't have access to normal tributaries -> special tributary type, which in particular persists across succession?
	- Once Feudal and controlling (directly or indirectly) enough of Aengland, you can take a decision to Establish the [Adjective] Supremacy, which means that Aenglaland is no longer lost upon succession
	- However, tributary kings are still very likely to rebel in moments of weakness if they don't like you (especially if you end up in a civil war), and if you lose control over enough of England you can still lose the title
	- Once you Establish Supremacy, you start gaining Influence score for all of your Anglo-Saxon subjects -> accumulates faster if you are strong and they are weak
	- Once you have accumulated enough Influence score (scaling based on the size of the kingdom) and there is a weak king, you can take a targeted decision to either depose him and forcibly take his titles and annex his kingdom to your own (e.g. Edward the Elder to Ã†lfwynn)
		- This will make your other tributary kingdoms very angry/scared of you -> possible rebellions, and of the kingdom you're trying to annex is strong enough they might decide to rebel against you instead
		- Their/your new vassals will also dislike you for annexing their kingdom, and might rebel at some point as well
	- Once you've annexed or vassalized all of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, triggers Unification of England event -> Aenglaland will now be considered a normal title, cannot be lost by being too weak
	- Change Earl to mean viceroyal king?
	- Decisions to invade/establish the Welsh Marches (Powys, Gwent, Glywyssing), then the rest of Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Normandy?
- Overhaul Saxon invasions of Gaul to use Raiding Adventurer mechanic
	- Choice to immediately usurp a coastal/riverside county when adventurer sieges down the capital
	- Former ruler's liege gets choice:
		- Immediately declare war to reclaim the county (if you lose, you have to cede the whole duchy)
		- Ignore for later
		- Allow to settle as laeti (adventurer keeps county, get province modifier, becomes vassal of former ruler) 
		- Allow to settle as foederati (adventurer keeps county, get province modifier, becomes foederati tributary of former ruler) 
	- Adventurer may demand the whole duchy if you choose to settle, especially if they're ambitious or strong
	- Adventurer may also decide to declare war for the whole duchy anyway, especially if the ruler is weak or distracted
- De jure shift for Frankish kingdoms on conquest of Burgundy
- Add decision for persecuting Christian missionaries as a pagan ruler
- Make Baskonia appear de jure after Frankish conquest of Toulouse?
- Decision for Imperial-cultured rulers to abolish Romanized Germanic kingdoms, with accompanying revolts

- Allow foederati for Feudal Germanic characters as well
- Briton culture split (into Welsh, Cornish, Cumbric)
- Add in custom death reasons

Git Instructions
Okay, first to download the mod you'll need to do an Git Clone. Because of the way the Git is structured currently, it's easiest to create the folder and then turn it into your mod folder (since the mod itself is inside; don't worry, it won't cause any problems as long as you don't add the other mods into the Git, which you would have to do manually anyway).

To do an Git Clone (i.e. get the mod for the first time):
- Right click inside your\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II folder
- Click "Git Clone"
- In "URL", enter "https://github.com/DC123456789/Britannia---The-Winter-King.git"
- Click "OK". Your folder should start downloading (it'll take a while, since the whole mod is there)
- Rename the folder to "mod" and put all your existing files and folders in your existing mod folder there. As long as you don't do anything with the other files with TortoiseGit it'll ignore them.

To do an Git Pull (i.e. check to see if anyone has made any changes and download them)
- Right click the folder/file you want to update (in most cases you'll want to update the Britannia mod folder)
- Go to the TortoiseGit menu arrow and click "Pull"
- Wait for TortoiseGit to finish looking for updates and download them.

To do an Git Commit/Push (i.e. upload stuff to the mod)
- Right click the folder/file you want to upload (in most cases you'll want to upload the Britannia mod folder)
- Click "Git Commit -> master"
- You'll get a new window with an empty space at the top and listing all the things you've changed under it. The empty space is where you should put comments to tell everyone what you've changed that commit.
- Click "Commit".
- Wait for TortoiseGit to finish uploading your files.
- Click "Push..."
- Click OK on the dialog box that pops up.
- At this point it should prompt you to enter your sourceforge username (the first time, I think) and password. Do so.
- Wait for TortoiseGit to finish pushing your files to the repository. If there's a conflict with another file someone is uploading at the same time that it can't merge it'll tell you and stop the commit.

To Show Log (i.e. look at all the changes that have ever been made to the Git)
- Right click the folder/file you want to see the log of (in most cases you'll want tosee the log of the Britannia mod folder)
- Hover over "TortoiseGit"
- In the menu to the right, click "Show log"
- You'll be able to see all the recent revisions, with their number (useful for identifying what version they are), the comments, and what files have changed.

If you have any problems or questions, feel free to ask.
