Git Instructions
Okay, first to download the mod you'll need to do an Git Clone. Because of the way the Git is structured currently, it's easiest to create the folder and then turn it into your mod folder (since the mod itself is inside; don't worry, it won't cause any problems as long as you don't add the other mods into the Git, which you would have to do manually anyway).

To do an Git Clone (i.e. get the mod for the first time):
- Right click inside your\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II folder
- Click "Git Clone"
- In "URL", enter "https://github.com/DC123456789/Britannia---The-Winter-King.git"
- Click "OK". Your folder should start downloading (it'll take a while, since the whole mod is there)
- Rename the folder to "mod" and put all your existing files and folders in your existing mod folder there. As long as you don't do anything with the other files with TortoiseGit it'll ignore them.

To do an Git Pull (i.e. check to see if anyone has made any changes and download them)
- Right click the folder/file you want to update (in most cases you'll want to update the Britannia mod folder)
- Go to the TortoiseGit menu arrow and click "Pull"
- Wait for TortoiseGit to finish looking for updates and download them.

To do an Git Commit/Push (i.e. upload stuff to the mod)
- Right click the folder/file you want to upload (in most cases you'll want to upload the Britannia mod folder)
- Click "Git Commit -> master"
- You'll get a new window with an empty space at the top and listing all the things you've changed under it. The empty space is where you should put comments to tell everyone what you've changed that commit.
- Click "Commit".
- Wait for TortoiseGit to finish uploading your files.
- Click "Push..."
- Click OK on the dialog box that pops up.
- At this point it should prompt you to enter your sourceforge username (the first time, I think) and password. Do so.
- Wait for TortoiseGit to finish pushing your files to the repository. If there's a conflict with another file someone is uploading at the same time that it can't merge it'll tell you and stop the commit.

To Show Log (i.e. look at all the changes that have ever been made to the Git)
- Right click the folder/file you want to see the log of (in most cases you'll want tosee the log of the Britannia mod folder)
- Hover over "TortoiseGit"
- In the menu to the right, click "Show log"
- You'll be able to see all the recent revisions, with their number (useful for identifying what version they are), the comments, and what files have changed.

If you have any problems or questions, feel free to ask.
