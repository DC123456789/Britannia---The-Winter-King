	- Added new Expand March cb, which can be used similarly to the normal Duchy Invasion cb to conquer duchies neighbouring one of your marches 
	- Marches can be revoked, which will destroy the title and return all vassals to the overlord, though they may revolt

Current Plans (What you are currently doing and what you plan/want to do for this patch):
- Add Marches
	- Edit Earldom of Wales/Pictland events
- Added Local Resistance/Resentment and Major Revolt mechanics for Wales, Armorica, Caledonia, and Vasconia
	- Provinces in these regions controlled by a realm of the wrong culture will receive significant tax/levy/garrison size maluses and revolt risk increases
	- This modifier can be reduced and eventually removed by spending gold to Pacify each province individually
	- If a revolt gains a certain amount of warscore, a Major Revolt will begin, which will dramatically increase revolt risk across the region
	- During a Major Revolt, if enough of the rebels win, the entire revolt will succeed and the defender + marches will be forced to abandon the entire region
	- Can sponsor and join revolts as a neighbouring lord or vassal of the right culture
- Imperial Improvements
	- Improve Roman colonies job action to have multiple levels of colonies and significantly speeding up Romanization at the highest level
	- Turn Imperial Reconquest into a Roman province-level cb (with gold/prestige costs and timer), give Imperials access to Duchy Invasion to compensate so they can continue to have a duchy-level cb
- Add new tribal revolt type - triggers for tribal provinces controlled by wrong culture group/wrong religion group feudal rulers, essentially like a liberation revolt but with looser requirements
- Mjoll invasion of The Isles alongside the Great Heathen Army?
- Decision to unite Scandinavia with Germania
- Allow Germanic kingdoms to be created more easily (not just by the specific culture, but by any non-Romanized Germanic)
- Remove the special Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and let the Anglo-Saxons use the Frankish kingdoms instead (with cultural renames)
	- k_neustria becomes Niewsterland (or "Niwesterne") as before
	- k_franks becomes "Fleamdra"/"Flæmingas" (Flanders) or "Francan" (Franks)/"Francland" (Frankland)
	- k_orleans becomes "Lygere" or "Lygeraland" (Loire)
	- k_ripuarian_franks becomes "Hreopware" (Ripuarians)
	- k_aquitaine becomes "Æcwitanas"
	- k_burgundy becomes "Burgendas" or "Burgendaland"
	- k_vasconia already becomes "Wascaland"
	- k_provence becomes "Profentse"
	- Add a e_saxon_gaul empire (Englarice/Seaxnarice/Eotarice/Frisenarike) - basically an alternate Saxon version of e_franks
		- Frankish kingdoms in Gaul become de jure under e_saxon_gaul when created by an Ingvaeonic ruler
		- Eventually, once either e_franks or e_saxon_gaul are created, all the Germanic kingdoms in Gaul will flip to one or the other
		- e_franks and e_saxon_gaul are mutually exclusive and require destroying each other to form
		- When this happens, e_aengland gets renamed to "Brytænglaland" as e_saxon_gaul has higher prestige

- Tribalism Mechanic
	- Represents how tribal/unsettled the population of a province is, from 100 (very tribal) to 0 (very settled/urban)
	- At start, high in Scandinavia/Ireland/Caledonia, mid-high in Outer Germania, mid-low in Outer Britannia and Inner Germania, low in Inner Briannia, none in Gaul
	- High Tribalism increases tribal holding levies/garrison, but increases build costs and time for all holding types and decreases castle/city levies + taxes
		- To compensate, lower tribal buildings will be made cheaper and faster to build
	- Tribalism will slowly rise or decline based on the number of buildings built in the province, so that as you build up your Tribal holdings Tribalism will decrease - this compensates for the growing number of levies you get from buildings
		- Castles and cities will decrease Tribalism faster
	- Provinces with mid-to-high Tribalism will have very high revolt risk with wrong-culture non-tribal rulers - replacing the current penalty on just any province with Tribal holdings
	- Provinces with mid-to-high Tribalism will have all Castles/Cities destroyed on conquest by Tribal rulers (to represent them getting abandoned when being retaken by tribes)
	- (some sort of mechanic to more organically represent Britannia becoming Tribal on Germanic conquests, while Gaul does not)
- Make Excalibur discoverable from MnM artifact events
- Invasion cb should take territory from rebellions as well
- Reduced culture/religion revolt risk for Sub-Roman and Germanic governments
- Take a look at chronic Frankish instability
- Make cbs less dependent on martial, more on prestige
- Make High Tribal, same culture/religion, de jure vassals more likely to favour lowering Tribal Organization and/or claimant factions than outright independence
- Anglo-Saxon overhaul
	- However, tributary kings are still very likely to rebel in moments of weakness if they don't like you (especially if you end up in a civil war), and if you lose control over enough of England you can still lose the title
	- Decisions to invade Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Normandy?
- Overhaul Saxon invasions of Gaul to use Raiding Adventurer mechanic
	- Choice to immediately usurp a coastal/riverside county when adventurer sieges down the capital (alternatively - when the adventurer wins a siege and at least half of the holdings in the province have already been looted)
	- Former ruler's liege gets choice:
		- Immediately declare war to reclaim the county (if you lose, you have to cede the whole duchy)
		- Ignore for later
		- Allow to settle as laeti (adventurer keeps county, get province modifier, becomes vassal of former ruler) 
		- Allow to settle as foederati (adventurer keeps county, get province modifier, becomes foederati tributary of former ruler) 
	- Adventurer may demand the whole duchy if you choose to settle, especially if they're ambitious or strong
	- Adventurer may also decide to declare war for the whole duchy anyway, especially if the ruler is weak or distracted
- De jure shift for Frankish kingdoms on conquest of Burgundy
- Add decision for persecuting Christian missionaries as a pagan ruler
- Make Baskonia appear de jure after Frankish conquest of Toulouse?
- Decision for Imperial-cultured rulers to abolish Romanized Germanic kingdoms, with accompanying revolts

- Sub-Roman/Germanic -> Feudal government mechanics
	- Add Vassal obligation amount laws and merge Conclave/non-Conclave vassal obligation laws
		- At start, realms will have highly tax-focused laws and a larger retinue size, which should become untenable as the economy collapses (i.e. in the 6th century) -> force shift to more levy-based laws
	- Law for allowing vassals to build higher fortification buildings
		- At start this is blocked, with a transition to allowing it as the Viking Age starts and it becomes increasingly difficult to defend the realm from all the hosts and raiders
	- Viceroyal succession -> For Imperial/Sub-Roman/Germanic vassals, title holder and liege get to vote on successor, with liege getting more votes than the holder
		- Enabled by rework of the Viceroyalty law
			- Three options: Full Liege Control (Liege always has more votes than the vassal)/Partial Liege control (number of votes depend on your traits)/Disabled (All viceroyalties are converted to hereditary titles)
		- Possible successors include close family members of current holder, de jure and de facto vassals within the realm, neigbouring vassals, and the liege himself
		- Decision to grant hereditary rights to the vassal, giving a big opinion boost in return for changing the succession type to primogeniture/gavelkind
		- Automatically given to newly created duke-tier and higher vassals
- Add back in some custom traits
- Add Branch of the Holy Thorn as a Christian artifact
- Conquered foederati given option to either continue as foederati for new liege, or revolt
- Allow foederati for Feudal Germanic characters as well
- Briton culture split (into Welsh, Cornish, Cumbric)
- Add in custom death reasons
- Some events to model the transition between 410 and the normal start dates
	- Anglo-Saxon invasions (to form Cantia, Sussex, etc.)
	- Frankish invasion of Belgica Secunda
	- Visigothic settlement of Aquitania
	- Burgundian settlement of Lugdunesis Prima
	- Alan settlements in Aureliania
	- Armorican revolts in Broceliande and Benoic
	- Rise and fall of Majorian
	- Creation of Domain of Soissons
	- Hunnic invasion
	- St. Patrick's conversion of Ireland
- Improve religious conversion and spreading of Christianity
- Event chains to simulate the Gaelicization of Picts through cultural exchange and trade
- Faster culture conversion for certain cultures
- Iona monastery event (that then leads to conversion of Picts and Gaels)
- Add chronicle entries for major events
- Expand use of chronicle
- Add Hadrian's Wall on-map
- Events to allow AAtY to become King of Guenet and then High King

Git Instructions
Okay, first to download the mod you'll need to do an Git Clone. Because of the way the Git is structured currently, it's easiest to create the folder and then turn it into your mod folder (since the mod itself is inside; don't worry, it won't cause any problems as long as you don't add the other mods into the Git, which you would have to do manually anyway).

To do an Git Clone (i.e. get the mod for the first time):
- Right click inside your\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II folder
- Click "Git Clone"
- In "URL", enter "https://github.com/DC123456789/Britannia---The-Winter-King.git"
- Click "OK". Your folder should start downloading (it'll take a while, since the whole mod is there)
- Rename the folder to "mod" and put all your existing files and folders in your existing mod folder there. As long as you don't do anything with the other files with TortoiseGit it'll ignore them.

To do an Git Pull (i.e. check to see if anyone has made any changes and download them)
- Right click the folder/file you want to update (in most cases you'll want to update the Britannia mod folder)
- Go to the TortoiseGit menu arrow and click "Pull"
- Wait for TortoiseGit to finish looking for updates and download them.

To do an Git Commit/Push (i.e. upload stuff to the mod)
- Right click the folder/file you want to upload (in most cases you'll want to upload the Britannia mod folder)
- Click "Git Commit -> master"
- You'll get a new window with an empty space at the top and listing all the things you've changed under it. The empty space is where you should put comments to tell everyone what you've changed that commit.
- Click "Commit".
- Wait for TortoiseGit to finish uploading your files.
- Click "Push..."
- Click OK on the dialog box that pops up.
- At this point it should prompt you to enter your sourceforge username (the first time, I think) and password. Do so.
- Wait for TortoiseGit to finish pushing your files to the repository. If there's a conflict with another file someone is uploading at the same time that it can't merge it'll tell you and stop the commit.

To Show Log (i.e. look at all the changes that have ever been made to the Git)
- Right click the folder/file you want to see the log of (in most cases you'll want tosee the log of the Britannia mod folder)
- Hover over "TortoiseGit"
- In the menu to the right, click "Show log"
- You'll be able to see all the recent revisions, with their number (useful for identifying what version they are), the comments, and what files have changed.

If you have any problems or questions, feel free to ask.
